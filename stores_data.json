Residents are also divided into six classes, differing in income, needs and transport preferences.\nThe second game differs from the first by the absence of a helicopter as a mode of transport, the ability to build roads, the change of day and night, the introduction of depots instead of simple ring lines, and also the presence of a multi-player mode.\nThe player is provided with a data collection system that informs about people's places of residence and work, the functions of buildings, the number of stowaways and so on.\nThe \"sandbox\" mode allows you to operate with unlimited resources and the ability to arbitrarily change any parameter, cancel all restrictions.

For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic.

Arkwright has to find the cause of the malfunction and restore control over the Fluros. \nThe gameplay consists of solving physics-based puzzles and manipulating the ridiculously complex machinery in a 2.5D environment. Arkwright jumps the platforms and pushes buttons to activate machines in a certain way. He can also use devices called Seeds to create new Fluros out of the liquids found on the levels, including lava. The Fluros, in turn, can be manipulated to perform helpful actions, such as to pull switches that are inaccessible for Arkwright. The liquid is the central element of the game, and a special graphics engine was made to animate it.

The choices within those arcs influence the ending outcome.","id":19530,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":11293,"name":"Big Finish Games","slug":"big-finish-games","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e315a1a1fbdc0035e8a7f390eee52539.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.texmurphy.com/"},{"description":"Assassin's Creed 2 Deluxe Edition is the second major installment of Assassin’s Creed series and the first with the main protagonist named Ezio. The first game in the series called Assassin’s Creed was praised for its mechanics and interesting setting yet it was highly criticized for being too repetitive and boring. It took 2 long years for Ubisoft to repair their mistakes and that resulted in Assassin’s Creed II. Now, the game looks a lot better not only graphical bus also gameplay-wise. It became much more interesting and epic. \nAssassin’s Creed II offers a fictional history setting which as in all the others games in franchise tells a story about the never-ending war between assassins and the Knights Templars who want to control the world. The story of the game is set in modern times and it fallows Desmond Miles who once again has to go into the machine called Animus to relive his genetic memories of his ancestor who now is Ezio Auditore da Firenze.  The main story takes place in Italy during the Renaissance period in the 15th and early 16th century. Cities of Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forli are fully explorable. Ezio fights those who betrayed his family and the player is kindly welcomed to experience this epic story as the Ezio himself.","id":13525,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3709,"name":"Ubisoft Montreal","slug":"ubisoft-montreal","games_count":122,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0bc/0bcc108295a244b488d5c25f7d867220.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.assassinscreed.com"},{"description":"VVVVVV is a 2D platformer designed in retro style.

Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.\n\n###Key features\nIn a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics.","id":54491,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":343,"name":"id Software","slug":"id-software","games_count":83,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58da72d37b507d498de66e124c4e266d.jpg"},{"id":13149,"name":"Midway Games","slug":"midway-games","games_count":73,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d889b984e9da663b5714ee712e6aae0.jpg"},{"id":14673,"name":"Lion Entertainment","slug":"lion-entertainment","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f30c9e3723ab978bbbb4e67c2de1ae.jpg"},{"id":14775,"name":"Lobotomy Software","slug":"lobotomy-software","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f30c9e3723ab978bbbb4e67c2de1ae.jpg"},{"id":27686,"name":"Tectoy","slug":"tectoy","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb1ac3b92dc59058aefece4a2bcc9f0.jpg"},{"id":14789,"name":"clickBOOM Entertainment","slug":"clickboom-entertainment","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3a8/3a82d7f5c90ab082fe475e28d58bee8b.jpg"}],"website":"https://quake.bethesda.net/en"},{"description":"The game from the legendary programmers John Carmack and John Romero, who worked together with American McGee, on the first-person shooter game that will run on anything: from mobile devices to engineering calculators.

Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.\nYou play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.\nIn the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.\nHellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.\nIn Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.\nIrid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.\nHellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we've had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.\nFor centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?\nHellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.\nThe more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.\nA terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...\nEvery time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.","id":22123,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":12860,"name":"Cradle Games","slug":"cradle-games","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7b00877d6290eedbf051cde0f814c0d.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.playhellpoint.com"},{"description":"Condemned: Criminal Origins is a grim crime thriller that lets you play the role of a detective and investigate the murder of a young woman. The game features a dark and paranoid atmosphere with some disturbing imagery. The player controls the protagonist, an FBI agent Ethan Thomas, who was summoned to a crime scene in an abandoned building. His job is to collect the evidence, such as fingerprints and fluids, and send it to the FBI forensic laboratory to find clues to the mystery. Thomas will use the information he gathered to solve puzzles and access new territories of the fictional Metro City. His goal is to track down the murderer who is likely a famous serial killer. The job proves to be dangerous, as Thomas has to visit some of the darker places in the town and fight thugs and psychos, while the main villain seems to keep an eye on him.\nThe combat system in Condemned: Criminal Origins is more realistic than in most first-person shooters. Here, firearms are able to kill people in one hit, however, they are seldom used, and the ammunition is very scarce. Ethan Thomas mostly uses improvised weapons, like shovels, wrenches and even a mannequin arm. Melee weapons also allow you to block enemy hits, and mastering timely blocks is essential to avoid being killed.","id":14422,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3813,"name":"Monolith Productions","slug":"monolith-productions","games_count":30,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4eaa50ded253689639fb29870e945d6a.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Download the manual for this game by locating the game on http://marketplace.xbox.com and selecting “See Game Manual\".

Earthlings survived the invasion of hostile aliens - and were able to repel him. The battles were not even on the planet Earth itself, but at the space station. And at this station there were many traces of carnage. From blood to parts of aliens, from holes in the walls from bullets and shells to broken glass. And now all this must be cleaned, collected, and the garbage must be thrown away. A game about space janitors, and an extraordinary task for them.\n\n###Gameplay\nIn the course of the game, it is necessary to solve the tasks related to cleaning up of the huge space station, which survived the battle between the inhabitants of the Earth and the alien invaders, from the dirt and debris. It is necessary to remove the most diverse and exotic garbage: remains of bodies of aliens and earthlings, shot casings and broken glass, medicines for the wounded, weapons and who knows what else. It is necessary to wash the floors and walls of blood and soot, to seal holes from bullets in walls, ceilings and floors.\n\nAs tools, players have a mop to wash out stains, a special device for detecting biological remains, and a PDA. You can interact with garbage and simply with the help of hands.\n\nAt each level there are devices for cleaning and recycling garbage: an incineration plant, a source of clean water, a container in which smaller debris is placed, such as cans, liners and body parts, a welding device for repairing holes in walls, and a vending machine where the player can get lights, medicines, a \"wet floor\" sign, other signs and lamps. Sometimes these devices work incorrectly and produce even more pollution.\n\nThe player can figure out how to use improvised tools to speed up and simplify cleaning. On the other hand, the player should think about how his actions will affect the situation and will not lead to even more pollution and the need to clean the same place several times.\n\nAfter passing each level, the player enters the so-called \"The Office\". This is the place where the work done at this level is summed up. The player sees what he missed to draw conclusions for the future.

Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!\n\nHOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?\nGremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).\n\nCAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?\nYes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.\n\nCAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?\nCertainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?\nThe game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.\n\nSHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?\nThere are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.\n\nMAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES\nThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release.\n\nFINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?\nYou think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.\n\nMore than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.\n\nA DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)\nWe felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.\n\nOUR DLC POLICY\nWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.\n\nThe game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).\n\nONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS\nGremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.\n\nAMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS\nThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.","id":10091,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4076,"name":"Charlie Oscar Lima Tango Interactive Entertainment","slug":"charlie-oscar-lima-tango-interactive-entertainment","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4ef40c72cf1378b15e840cfa4b1e263f.jpg"},{"id":4077,"name":"Alexey Bokulev","slug":"alexey-bokulev","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ab/7abe06b782564089d572fe7248a39f71.jpg"},{"id":4075,"name":"Sergei Klimov","slug":"sergei-klimov","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e566409f9f04bd3414d8819ce26ea3c.jpg"}],"website":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/369990"},{"description":"THE OLD WEST, 1864.

The first installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in North America in January 1999, and in Japan and Europe later that year. Silent Hill uses a third-person view, with real-time rendering of 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the console hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics. Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the player character of Silent Hill is an \"everyman\".\nThe game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill; stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin. Five game endings are possible, depending on actions taken by the player, including one joke ending.\nSilent Hill received positive reviews from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, and is also considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made, moving away from B movie horror elements, toward a psychological style of horror emphasizing atmosphere. Various adaptations of Silent Hill have been released, including a 2001 visual novel, the 2006 feature film Silent Hill, and a 2009 reimagining of the game, titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.

You assume the role of Jimmy Hopkins, a 15-year-old boy and a “problem child”, who was already kicked out of many schools for his misbehavior. \n\nGameplay in Bully is reminiscent of that in Grand Theft Auto games (made by the same Rockstar Games), albeit on a smaller scale. You, as Jimmy, walk around an open world of Bullworth Academy and its surroundings, finding new optional missions that may get you into trouble and fun at the same time. You can pick fights with other hooligans, fire at your schoolmates with a slingshot, drop stink bombs, ride a skateboard, and break into others’ lockers, as long as you don’t get caught by the teachers. You will also attend classes and perform exercises, which are rendered as mini-games. A smaller world, compared to GTA, means fewer characters, but each major character is interactive, fleshed out, and unique. The characters are split between several factions, or “cliques”, and Jimmy will have to complete specific missions to earn their respect. Completed tasks will also provide Jimmy with trophies that he will store in his room to commemorate his successes.","id":16787,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":9521,"name":"Rockstar New England","slug":"rockstar-new-england","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/3047372d6e91a4f0c7645d49459686bd.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.rockstargames.com/bully"},{"description":"A short experience about restoring a world featuring:\nPlatforming: Wall-jumps, slides, pipes, lifts, springboards\nBeautiful: Emotional soundtrack and vibrant visuals\nPeaceful: Non-violent, open world without death\nPlayful: Learn to play without tutorials\nRelaxing: Play at your own pace without pressure\nDynamic: Changing world and music-synced day/night cycle\nSeamless: Half an hour of uninterrupted quality playtime\nFor everyone: Enjoyable by a wide variety of player skill","id":11385,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":5344,"name":"Dominique Grieshofer","slug":"dominique-grieshofer","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f55144b0d61f42b7913f374675af1476.jpg"}],"website":"http://refunctgame.com"},{"description":"They Bleed Pixels is a 2D hardcore platformer featuring pixel art stylistics borrowed from Lovecraft compositions. This is the only title within the franchise.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game incorporates the hard elements from the titles like Super Meat Boy — not only the battle sections here are difficult due to the one-button attack system, but the platforming is challenging too as there are a number of regions where the blocks are covered by ice, and the player is required to perform a high-accuracy jumps while sliding. The death is common here as there are numerous ghastly obstacles along the level. Although the game features checkpoints they are only created when enough enemies' blood is accumulated within the heroine. So, the location without encounters means the place without checkpoints as well.\n\n###Plot\nThe story examines the adventures of a little teenager who enters a special school for girls only — Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies. The only difference is — the action takes place within her nightmares where she is forced to fight numerous squads of demons. After every level, the girl wakes up and through the course of the plot she begins noticing changes occurring to her real self, which are gained from her nightmares.

The game uses the Unity graphics engine and came out on three operating systems: Windows, OS X, and Linux. The game was originally supposed to be dedicated to the programming of nanobots, which are launched into the body of a living person, but the developer opted for a more appealing idea for a setting.\n\n###Key features\nThe plot tells a story about the player finding the faulty TIS-100 computer and the manual to it. TIS (Tessellated Intelligence System) is similar to the first computers from the 80s. Each level looks like a 12 program of nodes, located by a grid of 3 to 4. Each node has a processor register, behind which a certain numerical value is hidden. In order to solve the puzzle, the player needs to reprogram the node so that they perform specific actions using a simplified version of the real assembly language. In the version for Steam Early Access, which was released in 2015, 25 levels were available for the completion. Their number reached 50 at a full release.

Connect blocks (these can be square or triangle) to other blocks of their respective color to pass the level. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe goal is to connect the same colored shapes with non-intersecting lines. Depending on the difficulty of the level, there is a bigger network on which to do this, and more color sets to connect. It is a fairly straightforward title, but what makes it replayable is execution quality and unusual puzzle-solving experience. There are no timers, no enemies to kill, and no penalties for making mistakes. The puzzles are simple in the beginning but as time passes they become more complex. In a while, the player faces more colors, shapes, geometrical figures, lines. Lyne has several pre-made puzzles (650+), so it does not run out of levels too soon. Also, the game also offers daily challenges; they're called procedurally-generated puzzles. It also supports multiple languages. \n\n###Key features\nThe game mechanics are easy to follow. The player might get stuck on a puzzle, but every one of them can be solved.\nThe interface, in general, is smooth. The sound effects are string together in a pleasingly melodic fashion; they are soothing and quiet.

Unlike the original game, the sequel shifts its attention to the Pacific Theatre. The goal of the player is to defend his or her towers from the enemy units that attack from the air, land, and water, sometimes simultaneously. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game uses all traditional tower defense mechanics with only slight additions. Like in the previous iBomber game, the player controls his or her units in real time, using the top-down view. Most towers serve as AAAs and gun turrets that fire on the incoming aircraft and armored vehicles. There's also a Bomb tower that generates bombs which the player can drop at the enemies. The player can build new towers and units and repair them as well as to manipulate his or her towers to adjust their defenses to current needs. For example, the game introduces the Dig In option that allows the player to increase the tower's safety at the expense of its firepower.\n\n###Goals\nEach level features a new map as well as a primary and a secondary objective. The secondary objectives provide variety to the missions, as some of them require offense rather than defense. For example, the player can be tasked to disrupt the enemy supply. Completing objectives earns the player the Victory Points that allow him or her to level up and obtain additional perks.","id":6800,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6702,"name":"Cobra Mobile","slug":"cobra-mobile","games_count":29,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b108a7778d958b50e2e76e88c1c9c53.jpeg"}],"website":"http://www.cobramobile.com/steam/"},{"description":"Pre-Purchase OfferPre-purchase the Standard Edition today for bonuses including Warrior Thor and Evil Ryu costumes.\nPre-purchase the Deluxe Edition today for bonuses including Warrior Thor, Evil Ryu, Gladiator Hulk and Mega Man Command Mission X.The Deluxe Edition includes the main game and a 2017 Character Pass, which contains access to six all-new additional post-launch characters including Sigma, the main antagonist from the Mega Man X series.\nAbout the GameGAMEPLAY OVERVIEWThe epic clash between two storied universes returns with Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, the next era of the highly revered action-fighting game series.

Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery.\nImagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world …\nSuspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all, it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained!\nJoin American student Tannhauser, stranger in a strange land\nSet in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s\nInspired by Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Stranger Things & Star Trek\nIndulge in universal themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, self-discovery and dinosaurs\nHandmade miniature scenery!\nEnglish and German localization with full voice acting!\nAtmospheric, moody soundtrack\nComing to Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation®4 & Nintendo Switch\nA likely mobile port later!\nUp to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay!\nRelease scheduled for late 2018 – not the longest wait!\nTrüberbrook was successfully funded on Kickstarter in December 2017 within only 30 hours. The game will be enhanced by several new features thanks to the joint force of our 5078 wonderful backers! <3\nThe year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.\nOn a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, Trüberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.\nBut shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?\nGradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Gretchen Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Gretchen becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world!\nAs the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft.\nTannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature. Tannhauser is played by Justin Beard.\nGretchen Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village. Gretchen Lemke is played by Nora Tschirner.\nAs much a reclusive inventor as it gets, Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft? Lazarus Taft is played by Dirk von Lowtzow.\nTrüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, \"the weird kid\" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.\nOne of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!\nNot the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.\nThe models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.\nIt is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!\nEvery scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.\nThis way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook.\nTrüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.\nYou navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.\nFor the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation.\nThe soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits, Angelo Badalamenti, Mark Lanegan, Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader.\nWe've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors.\nIn the international English version, the main character Tannhauser speaks American English, while the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport a (more or less) German accent. In the German version, it's vice versa: the protagonist might have a modest American accent, while the townspeople welcome him in regular German, most likely with a dialect. Both approaches bear a certain degree of entertainment, each in their own way.","id":62499,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":7954,"name":"Headup Games","slug":"headup-games","games_count":58,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d4a32df624f52f320644a61e264076.jpg"},{"id":30811,"name":"btf","slug":"btf","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/933/933b583d788f9d899805d4ae31bf0696.jpg"}],"website":"http://truberbrook.com"},{"description":"Ravenswood: Shadowlands is the second installment in the Ravenswood series and the sequel to Ravensword: The Fallen King.

On each level, you have to defeat your town from waves of enemies crawling across the map.\nTo do so, you place towers which automatically attack enemies that get in their range of attack. There four types of towers in Kingdom Rush: Ranged Towers, Melee Towers, Mage Towers, and Artillery Towers. Ranged Towers shoot arrows at any enemy that gets in their sight. Melee Towers spawn troops that march towards enemies and engage in close combat. Mage Towers fire magic bolt that is especially effective against armored enemies. Artillery Towers are the slowest and the most expensive ones, but they deal much damage and can hit several enemies with one shot. Aside from placing towers, a player can use special abilities such as meteor strikes that directly damage any emeries on the map. \nThere are 12 levels in the primary campaign and several extra levels that can be unlocked after beating the game.

The basis of this synthetic work is the Scot John Buchan bestseller of the same name. This book has been screened many times. One of the adaptations was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n###Genre and story\nThe game follows exactly the text of the book. The book is a thriller, in the subgenre \"a man on the run.\" Events take place in London in the early twentieth century. The main character is accused of murder, which he did not commit, and he has very little time to prove his innocence and find a real killer. He escapes from the city, hides from the police and investigates this case.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main guide in the game is text. Much is reported in the voiced dialogues, scraps of phonograms, letters, newspaper articles and even fragments of the chronicle. There are several mini-games, tasks, performed by mouse movements. In total there are 8 different storytelling mechanics in the game, 25 collectible items and 16 awards to be unlocked.\n\n###Music, sound, atmosphere\nThe game contains more than two hundred hand-drawn frames. A lot of carefully selected details are immersed in the atmosphere of time and books. Old newspapers, photos, things, masterfully selected sounds - about the sound in the game is to be said separately, this is a huge and important part of the atmosphere of the game. It is considered, it seems, all - the sounds of passing mashtins, nature, the rustle of pages and creaking of the drawers. The game has its own soundtrack, the music follows all events, creating the right depth and maintaining a sense of total immersion. Dialogues are voiced by professional actors.","id":17878,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":10260,"name":"The Story Mechanics","slug":"the-story-mechanics","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef29fa65f8e13a67cc3f2c78215a068.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.thestorymechanics.com/digital-adaptations/the-thirty-nine-steps/"},{"description":"Known also under the alternative name “Madam, you are being hunted”, the game is a mixture of survival horror and the open world exploration. The game has a singleplayer mode, where players alone try to escape from the robots and do the same together with friends in the multiplayer mode. All actions are performed from the first person perspective.\n\nPlayers need to escape from Hunters, robots dressed like victorian-age gentlemen and their assistants: robodogs or worse. Robots must find and kill all players to get out of the island on which the action of the game unfolds. The landscape of the island is different during each playthrough - procedurally generated mechanics help to do so: the game engine chooses from five main themes - from the countryside to industrial areas.\n\nPlayers need to look for food and weapons to survive, besides, to spare parts for transport. The latter serves as the only way out of the island.

The player leads a geometric object – a circle when moving, a square when standing still.\nThere are four levels; each one has its soundtrack. As the game gets harder, the music intensifies. The player has to avoid enemies presented as other geometric shapes. There are also static noise platforms that should be avoided as well. The game is known for its synesthesia effect – a cognitive phenomenon associated with graphene, color, number or music-related experience. Someone with synesthesia can simultaneously observe things – for example, colors – like everybody else but at the same time distinguish their colors. Everything in the game moves according to the music beat, so to jump over an obstacle or to climb on a lift, the player should synchronize his moves to the rhythm. \n\n###Development \n140 was developed independently. It grew out of other Carlsen's works and proceeded similar features, for example, its minimalistic old school design and simple mechanics. The game was released on several platforms, such as Microsoft, PlayStation, and Linux. \n\n###Reception \nThe game aroused interest due to its minimalism and synesthesia traits. It was widely tested by critics and journalists and was praised for its design and audio background.","id":1366,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":16,"name":"Double Fine Productions","slug":"double-fine-productions","games_count":33,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/8548a73a29d09f953344855654583c4f.jpg"},{"id":4309,"name":"Abstraction Games","slug":"abstraction-games","games_count":23,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2fb/2fb35e31727f7ebc1f00bf998d0e22a7.jpg"},{"id":9928,"name":"Carlsen Games","slug":"carlsen-games","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7e/b7e8b764a79c31c533fccad365d8e230.jpg"},{"id":38381,"name":"CarlsenJeppe","slug":"carlsenjeppe","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560f7bd45d2f8ce3deb42c97fd1d1f49.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.carlsengames.com"},{"description":"Autobahn Police Simulator is the first simulation to realistically reflect the working life of a police officer on the German Autobahn. In numerous and diverse operations the player is responsible for enforcing law and order on Europe’s fastest roads.\nIn addition to the 40 missions revolving around the daily duties of the Autobahn Police, one can enjoy the extensive “Free Play” mode. This mode generates random radio calls for operations which the player is free to accept. All in all, this mode includes 100 additional operations at various locations and times of day. Accidents can be more or less severe and can also include trucks. The fully equipped patrol car houses all material needed to secure and inspect the accident site. Emergency vehicles, fire trucks and rescue services complete the scene at the accident.\nAnother option available to the player is to use the “Bitte folgen” (Follow Me) sign of the patrol car to flag down suspicious cars. Drivers trying to escape have to be chased down and stopped.\nIn the course of an inspection, the driver has to be examined for alcohol abuse, possession of drugs and for the roadworthiness of his car.\nThe simulation covers a total Autobahn stretch of 40 kilometres (approx. 25 miles). Some sections have a speed limit where the player can perform speed checks out of an unmarked police car.\nRealistic radio communications create a real life and exciting atmosphere, further enhanced by the day and night mode with its emergency light operations.\nThe game offers a view from within the car as well as from an exterior camera view with a free movement.

The only thing is required to enter the Labyrinth - make a step through a Portal of Mortals, which a tiny demon accomplishes.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game fuses together platforming, action, and puzzle elements together and creates a unique gameplay experience. This is not an easy game, as Mutts health constantly drops (although at a low rate), the traps of the labyrinth are very well hidden and take a large portion of health if Mutt is caught into them, and the unique monsters of the game want to have Mutt for dinner. There is only one way to defeat a monster, and it is to use a specific item that can randomly spawn on the level. In any other cases, your only option is to run away.\n\nThere is no autosave system present in the game. However, it is still possible to save your progress, as there is a bedroom behind one of the doors of the labyrinth. It is also possible to find a shopkeep, who will help you with items to fight the monsters only if you have the needed sum of money.

Your goal is to defeat a never-ending string of enemies which the game calls the ‘Monsters Girls.’ They appear as explicitly dressed young women with some animal or mystic creatures features such as cat ears, dragon tails or owl wings. You fight Monster Girls primarily by clicking on them with the left mouse button. They do not attack you so you cannot die in the game. Killing enemies gives you gold coins.

It may be worth waiting until we are further through development before getting on board (We're not going anywhere).\nHurtworld is a hardcore multiplayer survival FPS with a focus on deep survival progression that doesn't become trivial once you establish some basic needs. That feeling when you're freezing to death trying to make a fire, or you're defenceless being chased by creatures. These experiences are what make a survival game. When you overcome that challenge and find a level of comfort it's a great feeling, but what do you do next?\nHurtworld tempts you out of your comfort zone with rich resources, better loot and higher tech. It will also throw more dangerous creatures, harsher environments and new challenges at you that can't be taken on without the proper gear or refined skill. Will you settle for bows and arrows and a campfire, or push deeper into the map and start scavenging for vehicle parts and better weapons?\nBuilt from the ground up with solid multiplayer foundations. Designed for fast skill based PVP and PVE. You will constantly have to decide which is the biggest threat, the player opposite you or the creatures that will hear your gunshot.Current FeaturesCrafting Gear, Tools, Weapons and Machines - Combine what you find in the world to make hundreds of different items.\nStructure Building - Claim land solo or with friends, build from a hut to a city using our attachment point based structure system.\nProcedurally Generated, Customizable Vehicles - Find a car or quad bike wreck in world with random panels. Scavenge for parts and get it moving again. Find rare paint colors and skin patterns to get it looking just the way you want. Upgrade your engine and gearbox. Make sure to carry a spare tire!\nMining Resources - Heaps of different minable resources that require different tools to gather, from Pickaxes to Dynamite. Alternatively you can build some automated drills and let them do the work for you.\nTwitch based PVP - Some areas of the map will be highly contested, are you willing to share the limited resources needed to survive? If you aren't, we have many different projectile and melee weapons to do away with your opponent. Careful though, murdering your peers may increase your own penalty for death.\nFarmable Plants - Find wild seeds and get a crop going back home.\nHunting Neutral and Hostile Animals - Environment is filled with animals, they may be your lunch, you may be theirs.\nTown Ruins and Relics with Random Loot - Tightly contested, if the radiation and mutated creatures don't kill you, another player will. You might just find those engine parts you've been looking for here.\nDynamic Day/Night + Weather - Pick the right time of day to attempt crossing sand dunes, but watch out for sandstorms.\nStat Simulation - More than just a hunger bar, everything in the world is affected by time of day, current biome, localized effects like radiation, dynamic weather, heat given off by machines etc. Items can have different behaviors based on current stats too. That steak in your backpack might just freeze in the snow, at least it will take longer to go rotten. Put that storage chest too close to your fire you may come home to a pile of Ash.\nDrastically Different Biomes - Explore the harsh world. From the snow forests of the North to the colorful parrot Tokars of the red desert, gear that lets you survive in one biome may kill you in another. Players with a home base advantage will likely be better equipped to handle their surroundings than invaders.\nAll the features above are currently in the game and functional, however much of the content in these systems is placeholder. While we've done a lot of the hard work developing robust systems to underpin gameplay mechanics, we haven't yet spent a lot of time generating and balancing content for these systems. As this is mostly configuration work, we will be able to quickly deliver lots of new content in the coming months.Server Authoritative MultiplayerMost multiplayer open world games use a MMO style network architecture. While this allows for greater player numbers per server, it opens up the game up to endless cheating exploits that are impossible to stomp out. Hurtworld uses an architecture closer to that of a modern FPS, where all physics and game logic are calculated on the server. While cheats can never be fully stopped, this structure makes a large amount of the exploits impossible from day one. Due to this, our servers will use a bit more resources for the same number of people than your usual survival game, but we think it's totally worth it.PerformanceKeeping your FPS high and smooth is crucially important to us. As members of the PC master race we know 60+ FPS is a right, not a privilege. Not to mention PVP gunplay just doesn't work at low FPS. This is an ongoing battle while we are developing the game, adding new stuff slows things down, doing an optimization pass gives us some breathing room. It goes in cycles.\nCurrently things are running very well, we did a lot of hard work during our closed alpha to bring performance up and to get rid of big spikes. On mid range 2 year old machines we're currently getting 80+ FPS on medium settings. Our biggest bottleneck is player skinning on the CPU. Meaning if your CPU is a potato, and there are lots of players in your area, it will chugg. We have a fairly comprehensive graphical settings menu that should let you scale things down even on lower spec machines. We are constantly working to improve performance and we'll do our best to keep everything running well throughout early access.PVP & GunplayHurtworld has competitive FPS in its DNA. Violence isn't the only option, but when it's needed you want to be sure it's a fair skill rewarding system. We are keeping the gear cap low on PVP items. This means a player with 150 hours in a server and endgame loot can't faceroll their way around the map with impunity. Higher grade gear will allow you to survive in harsher environments and take on fiercer creatures, it won't however stop a bullet to the face.Infamy SystemWe are currently testing a new system that changes the way gear is dropped on death. By default all gear you have equipped like tools guns and clothes won't drop on death.\nSecured gear in your hotbar and equipment slots (gear you are wearing) can only be dropped if your infamy level is above zero.\nInfamy is a stat bar that increases by one every time you kill someone, and slowly decreases over time back to zero. For each point of infamy you currently have, you have a chance to lose a secured item (equipped gear / weapons / tools).\nWe hope this will have a few effects.\n\nMost people will actually use their best gear all the time\nNew spawns being harassed at spawn that can’t fight back won’t lose much\nPlayers harassing fresh spawns are putting a target on their own head, as some of their gear is now up for grabs to anyone who kills them, creating interesting skirmishes.\nFarming yield of a player will be dependant on the territory they can control. If a player tries to mine the limited resources around your base, you can kill them to claim the resources back without completely ruining their day.\nWe can make tiers of gear much more expensive to create without crossing the too valuable to lose bracket\nAs with any new gameplay system, it sounds great in theory to us, how it plays will be the real test. This behavior is currently enabled by default, however server owners can override playerlootmode to 4 different settings depending on preference including the classic lose everything.Modding\nModding is one of our top priorities. We have been working with the awesome guys at Oxide, to integrate their modding framework with Hurtworld. You can download their API right now and start writing server mods for Hurtworld in Lua, C#, Javascript or Python!\nIn the future we want to build Hurtworld into a platform for different sandbox game types (Think Dota 2 custom games). We are designing the game we want to play most, however the framework of player movement, gear, combat, environmental effects, AI, vehicles, construction and gathering can all be applied to vastly different game modes with very little work. We are slowly building up a more powerful SDK we plan to release sometime in 2016. I can't wait to see what other people do with a solid FPS framework with the backing of a fleshed out survival game.FAQ\nWill you add procedural maps?\nCurrently we are focusing on hand crafted maps. We are a good way through developing an SDK for Unity we call \"Shigi Tools\" designed to allow the community to create their own maps in-engine. It's not out of the realm of possibility that a server will have its own unique map designed by its admins that is downloaded on connection. This combined with server side mods should open up the gameplay possibilities a lot. We don't have an ETA on this yet, we are using it to build internal maps but it will require some new engine systems to handle runtime loading that we will prioritize amongst other things.\nCan I host a server?\nYes! We have a Windows and Linux headless server build that can be downloaded through the tools section of Steam or via SteamCMD, check out the Hurtworld Wiki for guides.\nHow many players per server?\nWe are optimizing for 50. We run all our physics on the server with low jitter and a high tickrate. This means we won't reach the 200+ mmo class of servers, however we think the tradeoff is worth it for a more responsive experience and a game more resistant to cheats. It also means we can do more interesting things with AI that feel more like Left for Dead and less like World of Warcraft.\nMAC USERS NOTE: If you get a crash on startup of the game, please disable Steam overlay","id":10976,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4957,"name":"Bankroll Studios","slug":"bankroll-studios","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f217ad15f844966fe0d5d240e5c73173.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.hurtworld.com"},{"description":"When darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four youths are chosen by the crystals to set forth on a journey to save the world.

Often this becomes a condition for further expansion.\n\nGames of the 4X genre usually have a very complex, detailed gameplay that takes considerable time to complete each of the four stages listed above.\n\nGrand strategy: the player rules the country or the empire, the actions of individuals or even large teams are usually not emphasized, the player acts by entire industries and armies.\n\nReal-time tactics: in games of this genre, all attention is paid to tactical actions on the battlefield - the location of units on the ground, the use of the terrain. Such games claim to reproduce the logic of real battles.\n\nTurn-Based Strategy: gameplay evolves as an alternation of turns of each player. In one turn in the game world can take many years, many units can make a maneuver, can change a lot.\n\n###Modes\nMode \"campaign\" - the game takes place on some part of the Earth, in a certain historical period.\n\nDuring one turn, the player can perform a number of very diverse actions: build, recruit and re-equip troops, change the location of troops, start negotiations, send a detachment of saboteurs on a mission or take part in a larger battle.\n\nTactical mode - the army fighting in a certain territory, and the battle takes place in real time.\n\n###Rome: Total War\nThis is the third game of the Total War series. The player plays for one of the factions of ancient Rome in the Republic from 270 BC (defeat of the last Apennine enemies of Rome) to the 14th year (death of Octavius ​​Augustus).\n\nTraditional gameplay for the Total War games.\n\nThe strategic part of the game takes place in Europe, West Asia and North Africa. Each turn is half a year. The theme of this game - Rome, - led to a greater emphasis on the military parts of the game.\n\n###Rome: Total War - Alexander\nThis is the second official extension to Rome: Total War. The first extension was the Rome: Total War - Barbarion Invasion game.\n\nUnlike all other games of the Total War series, this game can be played in just one faction - Macedonia, led by Alexander the Great. There are seven factions in the game:\n\nBarbarian Factions: Scythia, Dahae, Illyria.\nMacedonian Faction.\nEastern Factions: Persia, India.\nRebel Faction.\n\nThe number of turns in the game is limited - there are only 100 of them.

The player creates a battle robot and challenges other players' robots to a fight in an arena. The game features arcade action and simple WASD controls as well as many customization options.\n\n###Modes\nThe game includes three multiplayer modes. The first two offer traditional deathmatches and team deathmatches for teams of up to eight players, typical for most online shooters. There's also a Conquest mode, which is an updated version of Capture the flag. In this mode, the teams compete over control of a radio antenna. There's also a single player mode in which the player can compete against the AI-controlled bots. This mode, however, is only meant as a practice, as the bots are very weak and predictable.\n\n###Customization\nCustomizing your robot is the main focus of Gear Up. Before entering a battle, the player decides what weapons and movement gear the robot will use. The player can equip his or her robot with legs or wheels, melee or ranged weapons, as well as skills like invisibility or wall climbing. The game offers a roster of 116 parts, however, because of the game's free-to-play model, some of them can only be unlocked by purchasing. \n\nThe improvements are not perfectly balanced, and there are the obviously superior combinations that most players prefer.

Initially, the game was developed on Adobe Flash but was later ported to Facebook as an app.\n\n###Director's Cut features\nIn the Director's Cut, the players are able to create a completely new character instead of choosing from the presets. Randomized zombie spawns, boss encounters, and achievements were also added to the game. The original game was described as a parody on the educational game named The Oregon Trail, while the Director's Cut should be considered as a new title that pushes the concept of its source.\n\nWhile the original game was free-to-play, the players have to buy the Director's Cut in order to play it.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main objective of the game is to reach a zombie-free haven. In order to do so, the main character has to cross The United States in his old wagon. It is essential to manage food, water, ammunition, and car fuel in order to survive and arrive at your destination. Do not forget to take care of your party, by the way.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players have to either choose a preset character or create a new one. It is possible to choose from a cop, a lawyer or just a clerk. Every character has their own upsides and downsides. For example, while playing as a cop, the player will be able to search for supplies for a little longer, but the overall score will be smaller after beating the game.","id":2042,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":10000,"name":"The Men Who Wear Many Hats","slug":"the-men-who-wear-many-hats","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa5149fedbe6362b75d64eccc4d698b5.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.hatsproductions.com/organtraildc/"},{"description":"Collector's Edition\nIn addition to the core game, Black The Fall's Collector’s Edition includes the game's digital soundtrack, alongside a PDF artbook containing imagery from throughout the game's development process.\nSoundtrack listing:\nTrack 1 [04:49]: Dessolation\nTrack 2 [04:50]: Dissonant\nTrack 3 [05:31]: Glitch\nTrack 4 [06:24]: Hope\nTrack 5 [14:41]: Landscape For Every Escapism\nTrack 6 [02:29]: Outside\nTrack 7 [10:51]: Postlude\nTrack 8 [03:03]: Step Into The Light\nTrack 9 [08:08]: The King Is Dead\nTrack 10 [04:42]: Unexpected Friend\nTrack 11 [03:41]: Uplifting\nTrack 12 [02:35]: Void\nAbout the GameAfter decades of toil, an old machinist plots his escape from the oppressive grasp of the Communist regime.

It is based on the 2012 season.\n \n###Changes from the previous games\nWhile FIFA 12 did not change the gameplay dramatically, the game includes several important updates. The most notable is Impact Engine that calculates procedurally generated collisions based on laws of physics. The engine takes into account the players' stats as well as the speed and angle of the collision. This makes the game less predictable and more realistic. The engine also influences the injuries of the players. \n\nThe game also introduces a new Tactical Defending system that gives the player more control over his or her defenses, and the Precision Dribbling option that allows the player to protect the ball while dribbling it. Another new feature is Pro Player Intelligence that makes the AI-controlled players take into account their teammates' skills.\n\n###Teams\nThe game includes 29 national leagues and 42 national teams. Notably, however, both the Czech national team and league are absent, as well as several others that were present in FIFA 11. \n\n###Multiplayer\nThe game introduced Head to Head Seasons mode that offers the players to progress through the ten divisions during ten seasons of ten games each.

Wargame: Red Dragon follows a series of fictional yet plausible conflicts between the various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the campaign mode, its timeline covers the 1970s, 1980s, and up until 1996. The player controls various factions, both from Eastern and Western bloc.

That means that someone is changing the history of the clan. Sly and his friends use a time machine that brings them back to feudal Japan in order to fix the timeline.\n\n###Gameplay\nLike the previous installments of the series, the game is a platformer with several stealth-action elements.

It is possible to switch between the characters during the gameplay as the players see fit. \n\nUnlike the previous games, where Sly Cooper only unlocked new skills, in Thieves in Time, Sly is awarded new suits, that offer their own range of abilities. For example, using the archer suit allows Sly to shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it from his bow to get to hidden areas of the game.\n\nThere is a number of hidden treasures and masks in the game.

It is an online multiplayer-only game that allows a sort of second-person view. The players cannot see their opponents, but they can see what their opponents see.\r\n\r\n###Premise\r\nScreencheat is based on the idea of \"screen cheating,\" a form of cheating in local multiplayer in which the cheaters peeks at the other players' monitors to see what they're doing. This kind of behavior is unwelcome in most games, but Screencheat is built around it. \r\n\r\nThe characters in the game are invisible, and the players cannot see each other. However, they have access to other players' views. The screen is divided into four segments, in the vein of Goldeneye 007. Each of them translates a player's view so that everyone can see what the others do. It allows the opponents to track each other by detecting the locations of other players in respect to the environment.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nBeyond its novel idea, Screencheat is played as a regular 3D shooter. The player controls his or her invisible protagonist from the first person view. The characters have no hit points and die instantly if injured. The game offers a variety of weapons with different stats of accuracy and range, such as a shotgun, a grenade launcher, or a rifle. There are also comical improvised melee weapons such as a hobby horse.","id":2749,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":7768,"name":"Samurai Punk","slug":"samurai-punk","games_count":19,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b69d0e472477c1fd5a12bc2ab3229f5b.jpg"},{"id":1084,"name":"SURPRISE ATTACK","slug":"surprise-attack-pty-ltd","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c305353b224d8196489bbc4792a4c0b.jpg"}],"website":"https://samuraipunk.com/screencheat"},{"description":"Rise of Nations\nRise of Nations is a real-time strategy game that spans all history.\nStart with a single city in the Ancient Age; gather resources; build an infrastructure; research technologies; construct Wonders of the World such as the Pyramids and the Eiffel Tower; and expand your military might across the world, conquering hostile nations with bombers, battleships, and tanks—all over your lunch hour!\nIn Rise of Nations there are:\n18 Nations—each with special abilities and unique military units.\nOver a hundred military units operating on the ground, sea, and air— from Hoplites to Frigates to Helicopters.\nOver two dozen buildings with upgrades and technologies that will take your nation from a small City to an Information Age society.\n14 Wonders of the World—the Terra Cotta Army, the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower.

Luckily you can utilize numerous special mutations to make your troops evolve and fulfil their appetite for flesh. But beware! Humans will not facilitate your dark will….they will fight to survive.\nSpread terror through 40 levels and enrol more zombies into your undead army.

One of the slogans: “Save the World - Kill Yourself!”.\n\nThe terrorists are attacking a diner to get a tool for global genocide, killing about 10 billion people - such tools are in the secret laboratories of one of the Five Corporations located on the liner - “NanoCell Corporation”.\n\nThe protagonist, system engineer of the ship Kate Wilson, was responsible for the safety of the liner - when as a result of an attack by terrorists the ship begins to sink, Kate seeks to survive and tries to prevent the terrorists. What she needs for this, too, is in these secret laboratories.\n\n###Gameplay\nOne of the creators of the game described the gameplay as a “player against the environment”, meaning, first of all, water - water constantly interacts with everything it comes in contact with, and it gives an incredible variety of situations, sets of options for changing circumstances.\n\nWater floods the liner, constantly changing the configuration of spaces suitable for action and movement. The player must constantly adapt to this and respond quickly.\n\nOther characters can also affect the situation, and this effect also leads to a redistribution and movement of water. Water may involve other objects and substances in its actions — for example, a gasoline stain that has spread through water may ignite and burn, while water carries these fiery stains throughout the ship.\n\nThe action can occur both on the surface of the water and in its thickness.\n\nHydroEngine, an engine capable of solving this problem with unprecedented realism, was created to simulate flowing water in all its variety for the game.","id":4560,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":565,"name":"Cherry Pop Games","slug":"cherry-pop-games","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96c/96ca7f2d70f16272ca31b456907be459.jpg"},{"id":14012,"name":"Dark Energy Digital","slug":"dark-energy-digital","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f210242c29daff55599a4ac5e2c4ae1a.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.hydrophobia-game.com"},{"description":"Inspired by John Carpenter's \"The Thing\".\nA helicopter crash left a group of explorers stranded near an Arctic base.

It begins with a scrolling shooter level at which you pilot a spaceship, but the main part of the game is completely different. The player controls the protagonist named Yuri, who crash-landed on an alien planet and is searching for the villainous Grigori who destroyed his ship. Yuri is armed with a portal gun, a device that will teleport the character to where its projectile hits a wall. Unlike in Portal, you can teleport to almost any surface as long as it’s a solid object, the transportation is instant, and there are no lasting “doors”. \nEach level in Out There Somewhere is a small puzzle maze with an exit on the other side, and the player’s goal is to figure out how to get here. Yuri can “shoot himself” across the lava pits toward the other shore, through narrow corridors, or away from the villains. Initially, it is all about reaction, but eventually, the game introduces more complex mechanics, such as laser beams that divert or alter Yuri’s shots, and a regular gun that allows you to fight enemies.

They have only clothes and a cart with food. They are driven to the bare land and now they are fighting for survival. There is no money in their society, but they can exchange with the inhabitants of other cities that sometimes appear. Such trade is one of the key ways to obtain many critical resources.\nThese people from the very beginning of the game know all the necessary technologies, but they can use technologies only after they have accumulated the necessary amount of resources.\nThe basis of the game is the management of society in the conditions of limited all available resources.\n\nThe main resource are residents. They need not only food - they also need happiness. Without this, people will live less and die more often, the city will cease to grow. Residents are engaged in 18 crafts, from farmers to healers, in the bowels there are ore and stone, on the ground forests grow.\nFor winter, warm clothes and fuel are needed. Cutting woods for firewood can not be reckless. Old forests give way to the herds of deer, which feed the townspeople, as well as some medicinal plants. Unreasonable exhaustion of any resource leads to death. There is no universal strategy in the game - each time the amount of resources on the map is different.","id":11407,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":13271,"name":"Shining Rock Software","slug":"shining-rock-software","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bfa18254ae627cab7f0159a24d178cd.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com"},{"description":"“Keep your eyes on this one, because it’s one quality Action RPG” – Entertainment Buddha\nIn a world ravaged by war and dominated by magic, you are the last hope for the Empire of Man against the Chaos hordes.

Twenty years after the ending of Diablo II, a star has fallen on the city of New Tristram, spawning hordes of undead monsters that the player must defeat. As usual in Diablo series, the game has a trademark dark fantasy atmosphere and is mostly set in gloomy dungeons.\r\nThe basic gameplay features are the same as in previous Diablo games, but there are many subtle changes. The player can choose one of six character classes (a seventh is available with an expansion). Each class has its unique abilities and class-specific quests. Unlike its predecessors, which used isometric 2D graphics, Diablo III uses 3D, however, it preserves the familiar top-down view. The dungeons are randomly generated and have destructible environments, thanks to the new graphics engine. There’s a new mechanic Skill Runes that is used to improve the character’s skills.\r\nOnline multiplayer is available through Battle.net. There are both a co-op mode and a PvP mode called Brawling. The players can create hardcore characters who face permadeath if killed.

It was developed by the Japanese developer Grasshopper Manufacture. The release of the game on the PC is scheduled for the end of 2018. In short, what is waiting the player can be called a crazy incendiary hack and slash with the third person perspective, where the endless action and anime style graphics converged. Some aspects of the game are very reminiscent of Dark Souls.\r\n\r\n###The story\r\nThe story revolves around the corpse, which was suddenly revived. And yes - this is our main character if you can say so. Or the heroine - it depends on who you choose at the start screen. Anyway, if you die, you can just buy yourself a new shell and go on. There are a lot of locations to explore in the game. It depends on the player - exactly how to proceed - constantly using new bodies or to save money and after death to resurrect your favorite body. Note that it is very easy to die in this game. As for the goal - the player has to climb the tower, where at the very top lies the key to saving the whole world. There are more than forty floors in this tower. But this is only part of the story.\r\n\r\n###Change of plans\r\nInitially, the game supposed to be called Lily Bergamo, but at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the name was changed to LET IT DIE. The development lasted no less than three and a half years. Also, the release date was unknown at some point, but developers managed to deliver. It came out on the model of Free to play, which attracted attention and received a lot of people who wanted to play.","id":703,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":14146,"name":"Grasshopper Manufacture","slug":"grasshopper-manufacture","games_count":30,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/9157f38e482dd224e9420ff6ae09d75c.jpg"},{"id":434,"name":"Gungho Online","slug":"gungho-online","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a35588a674edeb3d96ced15bc0a896a4.jpg"},{"id":99786,"name":"SUPERTRICK  GAMES,Inc.","slug":"supertrick-gamesinc","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/da4/da4707919ac9397f98787c44db5ecafa.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.letitdiethegame.com"},{"description":"Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword is the second expansion of well-known turn-based strategy video game Civilization IV made by Firaxis Games.

The game resembles an online chat using an EOL messaging client running on an operating system that closely resembles Windows XP. There are multiple pop-culture references to the early 2000s era, such as the user profile icons, that resemble multiple old memes (like the Polish Polka), the icons on the main character's desktop that show that he is a fan of 28 Days Later, Lord of The Rings, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. \n\nAs the game goes on, the players are able to change their profile icon according to the tendencies of these years. It is also possible to interact not only with Emily, but also with their classmates, and the main player's friends. The main gameplay revolves around chatting with emilyluv (she will later change her nickname to emerly). You discuss your high school love with her and your classmate Brad that harasses Emily.

This results in fast-paced, Quake-like movement and Halo-like gunplay. At the beginning of the match, the players can choose any weapon present in the game starting with a 3-hit-kill pistol, an energy sword, and ending with a deadly sniper rifle. \n\nPlenty of game modes are present in the game. The regular competitive modes, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Point, and Capture The Flag are featured alongside with a completely unique Infection mode, where the players try to avoid becoming a zombie from a bite by another player, and a cooperative mode.\n\nThe game comes bundled with an in-game editor, which allows for the creation of custom maps. It is easy to upload the map for the other members of the community, hence why the game has one of the widest map variety in the genre.","id":16215,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":9206,"name":"JForce Games","slug":"jforce-games","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55877c5d5ad9c1d8ec4ed40cde3d800.jpg"}],"website":"http://jforcegames.com"},{"description":"Featured DLChttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1722010\nAbout the Game---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease note: THE GAME SUPPORTS BOTH MOUSE & KEYBOARD AND CONTROLLERS.

It can drill blocks, recycle them, and produce new blocks of different matter. Every matter has its own behavior and features. Tetrobot can also destroy lines of eight blocks just like in Tetris. \n\nThere are special blocks scattered around the game's story mode levels that cannot be drilled or recycled. Hence why the game is called Blocks That Matter. The only purpose of such blocks is to unlock bonus levels. Each block serves as a pop culture reference to games as Portal or even a Rubik's cube. Such special blocks can be found either on the levels or hidden in random treasure chests.\n\nThe game features 40 levels in its adventure mode and 20 more bonus levels. Every bonus level resembles a game with blocks in it, for example, Portal and its Weighted Companion Cube. Apart from that, the game is bundled with a level editor which allows for creating new levels and sharing them with the community.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by Minecraft and Tetris, which can be seen while playing through any level.

Upon arriving, she meets local, explores the surrounding and then goes to sleep in her room. While sleeping, she dreams of a Mysterious Woman that she met earlier this day. She turns protagonist old and makes her live an episode of four old people lives and decide their fate. \n\n###Gameplay \nEven though the game’s name presumes that this is a role-playing game, the gameplay shares more similarities with story-driven quests or adventure games rather than RPGs. There is no battle system or character advancement in Greyfox. The game mostly consists of interacting with NPCs and exploring the environments except for a driving sequence in the beginning. The game ends soon after you’ve lived all four days in other old people’s lives. However, there are some optional activities in the game.

Pony Island is a point-and-click game that simulates the operating system using the user interface. The main task of the player is to study the internal software shell of the gaming machine, where he got stuck and tried to escape the demon. The gameplay of the game changes constantly and the player needs to participate in mini-games like endless runner and shoot-em-up.\n\n###Money for the dream\nPrior to Pony Island, Daniel Mullins was already trying to release the game: right after college, in 2014, he collected the necessary money to develop his first game Catch Monsters. The successful crowdfunding experience allowed Daniel to pursue his dream and not work on boring work in the office. Pony Island was developed in just 48 hours, during the Ludum Game Jam, and later appeared on the platform for indie games Steam Greenlight. After that, the popular YouTube PewDiePie recorded and published a let's play of the game, after which the game gained enough votes, and a full release happened.","id":17741,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":7645,"name":"Daniel Mullins Games","slug":"daniel-mullins-games","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9d861f2f48cfeddaa6f49ac665d80d9.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.pony-island.com"},{"description":"The year is 1848.

The player begins with being a minimally possible creature and then consequently evolves into the bigger forms of life. The essential objective is to let the subject develop into the maximal number of organic entities.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe starting point for the whole narrative is a sparkle which transforms into other various organisms. The possibility of transformation mostly depends on what the player eats, that is the nutrition is the standpoint which determines the development of the narrative.\nThe game may be explored in two ways. In the first mode, the player is competing as a form of life against artificially controlled substances. The second way is more experimental — the contesting point is removed, and the target is to explore different possibilities of becoming anything or anybody else.\n\n###Key features\nThe game provides three possible ways of evolutional forms: herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore. Each path is unique, and the scenario of evolution can remarkably differ even if you follow substantially the same ration.

Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!\nThe Technology:\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!","id":22069,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":12821,"name":"Brilliant Game Studios","slug":"brilliant-game-studios","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2a162a08f2bba053334ecfda25228d.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0vQTkEQrF1NLQnRWwR6_A"},{"description":"Plague Inc: Evolved is a biological simulation/strategy game developed by Ndemic Creations.\n\nIn Plague Inc: Evolved the player controls a disease, that infects patient zero in a selected country.

The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.\n\n###Key features\nThe player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.\n\n###The story\nKing of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased.","id":39707,"alternative_names":["God of War 2"],"developers":[{"id":6,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","slug":"sony-interactive-entertainment","games_count":596,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6ac/6ac602e70c837ababdf025e997391d9c.jpg"},{"id":18445,"name":"SCE Studios Santa Monica","slug":"sce-studios-santa-monica","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/615/615e9fc0a325e0d87b84dad029b8b7b9.jpg"}],"website":"http://godofwar.playstation.com"},{"description":"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.\nYou play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a \"Cutie\" and a \"Punk\", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.\nA definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and \"heavy\" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature.","id":3987,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":5497,"name":"Black Forest Games","slug":"black-forest-games","games_count":16,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d5c/d5c7f753e3715a73827e10ed390c990c.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.project-giana.com"},{"description":"Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game's engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command & Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.\n\nThe definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and \"planet thrusters\"; and there are many such systems in the galaxy.

The two main gameplay innovations in SFIV are Focus Attacks and Ultra Combos. Focus Attacks are chargeable attacks that can knock down an opponent.

The player can take command of various soldiers from Allied armies, and take part in various campaigns in Europe and Africa. The three playable campaigns focus on the Soviet, American and British soldiers fighting the Axis, each encompassing traditional battlegrounds such as Stalingrad, El Alamein and Hill 400.\n\n###Gameplay\nCall of Duty 2 focuses on combining realism and entertainment in warfare simulation. The playable character can carry two firearms, unique for each country, utilizing each of them in different situations. UI has been changed drastically, removing the visible health bar and overhauling compass HUD. The difficulty system can provide a cinematic experience while keeping the gameplay realistic - on Veteran, each bullet can be fatal.\n\n###Visuals and other features\nThe game boasts a refined graphics engine, with smooth textures, good performance, and stunning effects. Explosions and falling buildings, bullets flying and artillery blasting the ground, every detail is done to ensure the immersion on the battlegrounds of World War II.

It is the third installment of the series.\n\n###Plot\nAfter changing his fate, The Prince comes to Babylon accompanied by Kaileena. It turns out that Babylon is under attack. Kaileena gets kidnapped, and The Prince sets out to find her. It is also revealed, that by altering his own fate, The Prince prevented the creation of the Sands of Time from ever happening, so the timeline changes. It is your job to fix it back up.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of The Two Thrones is closer to the first installment in the franchise - the acrobatics play an important role. The combat system is almost the same as it was in the second game. The player still has two weapons (one main and one temporary) and can perform combos. For the first time in the series, the Prince does not have his swords, and a dagger is used instead (replaced with the Dagger of Time later). The temporary weapons now have a certain amount of damage they can sustain. \n\nThe Prince can now transform into a Dark Prince, whose health goes down quickly, but can be instantly regenerated with sand. Dark Prince's gameplay changes drastically as it encourages fast-paced combat without relying much on tactics. However, all the transformations happen strictly on plot occasions.","id":13926,"alternative_names":["PoP TTT"],"developers":[{"id":405,"name":"Ubisoft","slug":"ubisoft","games_count":335,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/82e/82eeea65ebb047cc7f366faf2fb062b6.jpg"},{"id":3709,"name":"Ubisoft Montreal","slug":"ubisoft-montreal","games_count":122,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0bc/0bcc108295a244b488d5c25f7d867220.jpg"},{"id":17382,"name":"Ubisoft Casablanca","slug":"ubisoft-casablanca","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/375/375f84d018242d7519a230f623981217.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.princeofpersiagame.com"},{"description":"For 3-8 Players and an Audience of thousands!\nThe team behind the hit party games YOU DON’T KNOW JACK, Fibbage, and Drawful presents Quiplash, the laugh-a-minute battle of wits and wittiness!

Then the protagonist starts to glow, the bars he's collecting rise up. When they do, the music rises, and the player's trajectory burns a bright red line in the air. Each line acquires big mathematical curves of the arcing flight.

There is still one condition present in the game - the players can't put any turrets too close to the enemy trucks, adding to the game's difficulty.\n\nShould the players start a solo game, five difficulty levels will be available to them.

The game is designed in a very simplistic pixel-art style. Pixel Piracy plays with all sorts of jokes and comical stereotypes about pirates.\n\n###Setup\nBefore the game starts, the player has to choose the difficulty level and other options by answering questions about the game's world and its main character. Initially, the player only controls a single pirate, the would-be captain. The protagonist is partially customizable: the player can choose the character's look from several presets. As the game begins, the character has to build a ship and recruit a crew before they can set off to the sea. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe goal is to lead your crew to fame by defeating enemy pirates. Other than that, the player is free to explore the map, fight enemies to gain prestige points and upgrade the ship and the crew with new equipment. The pirates belong to various classes. A crew needs fighters to attack enemies, sailors to control the ship, a carpenter to fix it, and a cook to make food. \n\n###Genre\nWhile Pixel Piracy is more of a strategy, there are some features of the roguelike genre. The world is procedurally generated, and the crew will randomly encounter feral beasts and hostile pirates from other gangs. The player has to keep track of the ship's resources, otherwise, the crew might die of starvation or lose its morale. As in the most roguelike games, the death of the main character is permanent, and he will not respawn if killed.","id":2798,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":237,"name":"505 Games","slug":"505-games","games_count":51,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09c4e62ffe10a6f087d9f86e2e562681.jpg"},{"id":9154,"name":"Vitali Kirpu","slug":"vitali-kirpu","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa488b87616202e9c335b78c12b3aeb.jpg"},{"id":3986,"name":"Quadro Delta","slug":"quadro-delta","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa488b87616202e9c335b78c12b3aeb.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.quadrodelta.com"},{"description":"Waaaaay back -- before Endless Legend, before Dungeon of the Endless -- Opbot was just another Field Surgeon and Organ Recovery Specialist in the Mezari military.\n\nThen, one day, something happened... and Opbot found themself on the run.

Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer.

It is a spin-off to the Gears of War series.\n\n###Plot\nJudgment serves as a spin-off prequel to the original Gears of War. On a distant planet named Sera, humanity suffers from a sudden invasion of the Locust Horde. Nothing is known about the enemy, and the human government is unable to deploy its military forces quickly. The story revolves around a military court process against the four-person Kilo squad. \n\n###Gameplay\nJust like in all previous installments of Gears of War, Judgment is a third-person shooter featuring an over the shoulder perspective with an addition of an advanced cover system.\n\nThe levels of the game are not as open as they used to be in the previous games. Now, the players fight in small and dense urban environments. Missions serve as self-contained story parts with no backtracking present in the gameplay.\n\nThe game features a scoring system that evaluates the player's performance. There are two main criteria that matter: a number of the player kills and the number of headshots made. A harder difficulty is offered before the mission launch. This can activate a special weapon restriction or set a time limit. Completing a level on such difficulty will increase your score.\n\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode that was not changed much since the last game apart from the addition of two new game modes: OverRun and Free-for-All. Eight maps are available to the players.","id":28628,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":120,"name":"Epic Games","slug":"epic-games","games_count":46,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/87f/87fa0402c2e00c3b37157c6900058b8f.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Evoland 2 is an indie role-playing game developed by Shiro Games. It is the second installment in the Evoland series.\n\n###Setting\nThe players travel through four time periods which differ in their historical setting. The art style of each period matches 8-bit graphics, Nintendo's Game Boy graphics, 16-bit graphics, and finally 3D graphics. You play as Kuro, who sets out to the past to change the fate of humanity and the outcome of a war between the powerful demons. Players change the past in order to affect the present.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is fairly linear, but it opens up at some point of the story. The fighting system of the game consists of both real-time fights and turn-based battles. The players are free to explore the in-game world from a bird's view perspective. It is possible to search for collectibles that are placed in secret areas around the game's levels. \n\nThe game pays tribute to numerous games. Most of these tributes are made during the game. While the main part of the game closely resembles the Legend of Zelda game series, the players will participate in a Street Fighter parody game or a sidequest mini-game that was inspired by Final Fantasy. \n\nThere is a lot of humor present in the game.

Later the game appeared on Steam in the extended Deluxe edition, which included the original game, the soundtrack and the DLC of Teleporter Chambers.\n\n###Fast paced stealth\nEach level of the game is a streak of obstacles, which requires the player to the accuracy of the pixel while moving forward in the shadow. The game has a dynamic lighting system, so it will not work staying long in one place. Developers have added this system in order to speed up the game process: they do like stealth games, but don’t like their speed.\n\n###Key Features\nIn the singleplayer campaign, there are 80 levels in eight worlds, tons of puzzles and enemies. The player in the arsenal has nothing but a pair of night vision goggles, so you have to rely solely on stealth to make your way through the levels.

The previous titles were mostly focused on multiplayer with large numbers of players.\n\nThe game is retaining the vehicular and large-scale warfare but emphasizes squad-based combat.\n\n###The First Russo-American War and the private campaign of Bad Company\nSerdaristan, a small Caucasian country, became a place for a big war between Russia and the United States. First in Serdaristan, then in the Middle East, in the town of Sadiz on the coast of the Caspian Sea, the 222th Battalion, also known as the \"Bad Company\", puts itself under bullets. The name \"Bad Company\" is not accidental - the detachment consists of people who are best able to deliver problems.\n\nOne of the columns of the Bad Company was destroyed when it was sent to the battlefield. In investigating this case, the Bad Company's soldiers find out that they are not opposed by the Russian army, but mercenaries to whom Russia pays gold. Since then, the Bad Company has been fighting not only for the victory and glory of its country, but also for the sake of gold, which can be obtained in the pockets of defeated opponents.\n\n###The Newby and the Team\nPreston Marlowe is the main protagonist of the game. He just came to the Bad Company - just before the Bad Company found a new goal for itself - gold.\n\nSergeant Samuel D. Redford is the commander of the Bad Company and the only one who came there as a volunteer. He just likes to fight.\n\nGeorge Gordon Haggard, Jr. - has an explosive nature. And he knows everything about explosives.\nTerrence Sweetwater - smart ass.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player acts with one main weapon and another, used in the second turn. In addition to this, there are grenades, a knife and portable explosive devices. The player always has information about the number of remaining ammunition. If vehicles are not completely destroyed, they can be repaired any number of times. \n\nMilitary vehicles in the game are sufficient: infantry fighting vehicles, armored cars, tanks, attack helicopters, patrol boats, mobile anti-aircraft weapon system.\n\nFor the first time in the Battlefield games line, the Frostbite game engine is used - 90% of the environment can be destroyed. Destruction is subject to almost everything: trees, grass and bushes, vehicles, other players and even the ground itself. Lighting is adjusted for changes caused by destruction.\n\n###More and more\nGold Edition\nThe main feature of this edition is that it immediately makes available those types of weapons that are usually unlocked after reaching level 25.\n\nFind All Five\nThis addition allows you to unlock five types of weapons that are not available in the main game - the F2000 machine, the USAS-12 automatic shotgun, the M60 machine gun, the QBU-88 sniper rifle and the Uzi submachine gun with the silencer.

The main objective of the game is to paint wooden sculptures using a rope to wrap them up. As the rope touches the sides of the object you are tying it around, they get painted. The players have to completely cover the sculpture with paint using as less rope as possible. There are three completion goals present in the game - minimum, medium, and max paint coverage. The players have to be careful, as the rope is not infinite and the players can run out of it if they use it irresponsibly.\n\nMost of the game's sculptures resemble animals, birds, geometrical structures, or building components.\n\nThe developers call Zen Bound 2 a down-tempo experience, which puts a heavy emphasis on the ability for its players to calm down and focus only on the task that is rather challenging, yet is not stress-inducing.\n\nFor those who still want some challenge, the game offers a Challenge mode.

It is the second part of the Resistance trilogy.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place right after the ending of Resistance: Fall of Man. Nathan Hale wanders somewhere in a snowy forest after the destruction of an alien tower in London. Suddenly, a black ops squad finds him. They put their guns up on the protagonist and demand that Hale goes with them. At first, Nathan wants to blow himself and all the soldiers up with a grenade, but changes his mind and complies. His fight against the alien Chimeras continues.\n\n###Gameplay\nResistance 2 is mainly a singleplayer game. Many weapons from Fall of Man were reused, with several new additions such as the Marksman and a minigun. The game is based in the 1960s, so the weapons resemble a mix between the common weaponry of the time and advanced alien tech. Unlike the first game, the players can only carry two weapons at all times. \n\nResistance 2 goes away from the health bar system in favor of regenerative health. That means that now the players have to stick to cover when their health is low to regenerate it.\n\n###Multiplayer\nA multiplayer mode is also present in the game. However, there is no cooperative play in the singleplayer campaign. \n\nThere are two multiplayer variations: a separate co-op campaign and a competitive one. The game was praised for having up to 60 players in one competitive session and up to 8 in a cooperative mode.","id":5640,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","slug":"sony-interactive-entertainment","games_count":596,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6ac/6ac602e70c837ababdf025e997391d9c.jpg"},{"id":5342,"name":"Insomniac Games","slug":"insomniac-games","games_count":37,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d98/d988519c04c40968dc96c54b07ae8d6b.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Resistance_2"},{"description":"Unleash a fury of powerful weapons as you blast your way through armies of Alien forces hell-bent on taking you down!

When you start playing, you have a limited set of skills, but you can pick CDs from enemies to unlock bonuses or to acquire ultimate power. Every new ability, you unlock, forces you to get used to a new tool, so it makes the game process more tricky and challengeable. The player has to collect six CDs to unlock all achievements and get to the final fight. There are a few modes. In the Story mode, you need to finish five levels. After accomplishing it, the player can try the Time attack mode, where you aim to kill foes for a limited time. Alternatively, try the Endless mode. There you have to fight with never-ending units of foes. Every new wave is stronger than the previous one. However, there is an indicator, showing you the location of the new enemies. \n\n###Art style \nSavant has composed each song, and it fits in with the environment of the game.

The game has a minimum of hints, and puzzle solving is often very unobvious.\nThe plot of the game moves forward with the actions of the main character - Rufus, who lives on the planet of Deponia, long ago turned into a dump. Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.\nHe calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation \"Organnon\", to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots.

Wander into the forest and help bring it back to life with the help of Fen, your creature guide. Evergarden may feel familiar at first, but you will discover it is like no game you have played before.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSQ: What type of game is this?\nA: Evergarden is an “evergreen” puzzle game, set inside a narrative adventure.\nWe’ve spent years developing the core puzzle game to be accessible and relaxing, but also very deep and strategic. On a basic level, you’ll combine plants on a board to create more valuable items, and grow your garden within a turn limit. The game holds a lot of secrets though, and most players will spend months mastering the strategies required to get a great score. This portion of the game also has a leaderboard.\nBeyond the garden puzzle board, there lies a mysterious forest environment to explore, with its own puzzles and progression. You’ll use the stones that you earn by playing the core puzzle board to solve puzzles, and unlock new “songs” which add depth and fun to the puzzle board.\nQ: How long is the game?\nA: The core puzzle game is “evergreen”, which means you can play it repeatedly and keep mastering it, without ever truly “completing” it. The adventure game portion will take most players 4-8 hours to explore, and there is also a daily challenge portion with a new procedural puzzle to unlock every day.","id":60624,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":5069,"name":"FlippFly","slug":"flippfly","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a01/a01b34c722ceec784817381eb1824fa5.jpg"}],"website":"http://flippfly.com/evergarden/"},{"description":"Welcome to the land of summer, a remote valley untouched by war.

The authorities created a new special service named Group Six that acts as a combination of secret police and counter-intelligence and hunts for the possible future conspirators.

The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne’s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind.

Like its predecessor, it is based around parkour simulation.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the near future that is depicted as a cyberpunk dystopia. The story takes place in the city of Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst. She is a Runner, a person who specializes in illegal delivery. Early in the game, Faith steals a valuable hard drive from a corporation. After reading its data, she learns about the Reflection project that will allow the corporations to control every resident in Glass.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow.\n\nThe combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.\n\n###Style\nLike its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields.","id":2354,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":109,"name":"Electronic Arts","slug":"electronic-arts","games_count":323,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/369/36914d895c20e35f273286145c267764.jpg"},{"id":18111,"name":"Electronic Arts DICE","slug":"ea-dice","games_count":41,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/998/9980c4296f311d8bcc5b451ca51e4fe1.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.ea.com/games/mirrors-edge/mirrors-edge-catalyst"},{"description":"Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is a combat flight simulator game, the 13th installment in Bandai Namco’s Ace Combat series. \n\n###Plot \nThe story takes place in 2015 in different places across the world, including Miami, Russia, East Africa, and the Middle East.

All of us at Camouflaj are anxious to finally release the fifth and final chapter of République. To all of you who waited patiently for the series conclusion, we deeply appreciate your patience and support. The team here at Camouflaj put our hearts and souls into this epic final episode -- we hope you agree that it was worth the wait.\nJust as we did with previous episodes, Episode 5: Terminus is not just an additional chapter but it comes with thousands of fixes and enhancements. Here’s a breakdown of the major changes we made in addition to adding the fifth episode:\nImproved performance, crash frequency, and optimized framerate for lower-end devices\nResolved issue where Hope falls out of the game world on some machines with AMD graphics cards\nFixed issues regarding Hope’s trouble retrieving the EP3 cassette at beginning of episode, near desk in Reception Area\nUnity default typeface no longer appears by default in certain prefabs (English alphabet only)\nImproved and revised navigation, pathfinding, and collision in Episode 1-3\nImproved camera rotation limits and view in all episodes\nUI and pop-up improvements in all episodes\nUpdated 2D art for some scannable items in Episode 1-3\nIn addition to the upgrades we’ve made, here is some of the new stuff you can expect in Episode 5 (without spoiling too much):\nHostile Cameras: These new security cameras scattered throughout the game world will scan Hope and alert guards to her presence. Players can only inhabit them for a limited time, adding a neat layer of complexity to the gameplay loop.\nBranching Paths: This is something we’ve kept close to the vest for a long time: EP5 has branching paths that change the course of the episode based on a decision you make early on. We don’t want to reveal too much, but this is a huge addition that greatly expands the content offered in Episode 5, offering a nice incentive to play through the campaign again.\nA New Metamorphosis: Players are returning to the world of some previous episodes, but will find it looking and feeling much differently than before. You’re going to see new areas, meet new enemies, and forge some interesting alliances…\nWe want to say more, but it’s better if you to experience it for yourself!\nWhen you’re done with the game, I encourage you to check out our final installment of The Making of République (available now in the Deluxe Edition), and take a look back on the production of this massive, four year endeavor. We’ve prided ourselves on giving you a window into our world by providing open and honest in-game developer commentary tracks, and these video documentaries are an extension of that. You might even see some old footage from back when we were younger, healthier, and less sleepy.\nFinally, we want to give a shout out to composer Zinc Lemone for his work on Episode 5’s soundtrack (also included with the Deluxe Edition.) I’ve had some standout favorite tracks in previous episodes, but EP5’s soundtrack in simply incredible from start to finish. (“Loose Change” is the *JAM* y’all.)\nWatching Episode 5’s final moments come to life this past year has been bittersweet. It’s hard to believe that we are finally at the finish line after first announcing the game back in 2012. We owe a lot to our initial Kickstarter backers, our publishing friends at GungHo Online Entertainment, and our stellar voiceover cast including Rena Strober, Jennifer Hale, David Hayter, Dwight Schultz, and Khary Payton. It’s not an exaggeration to say that République is the product of thousands of people coming together and making it a reality.\nThank you all, from the bottom of our hearts.

As it grows in size, it becomes a dwarf planet, then a planet that can sustain life. Growing further, it may become a star with its own planetary system, and eventually a black hole. \n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to gather all of the universe's mass into a big crunch. Then it will explode and recreate the space with a Big Bang. However, the player is free to stay at any size instead and not to complete the main goal. There are also optional missions that the player can complete to receive achievements.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player navigates his or her astronomical object through space, which is a randomly generated open world. To accumulate your object's mass, you have to collide it with smaller objects and absorb their matter. The objects that are larger than yours will only take its mass away if you hit them. Your object can decrease in size, but it cannot downgrade from a planet to asteroid or from a star to a planet.

The main character sets out to kill all the cultists. \n\nThe developers say that there is not much plot present in the game and want the player to think they are saving a princess. Although, that is what you are doing.\n\n###Gameplay\nChaos Domain is heavily influenced by the old side-scrolling games of the Sega Mega Drive era like Contra. The main objective of the game's levels is either to get to its end or beat a boss. There are 30 levels present in the game. The players have to complete their objective in a limited amount of time getting the most points possible.\n\nThe game features a weapon upgrade and ability systems. The players can purchase abilities and weapons in an in-game store using the points they got awarded after playing a level. \n\nThe game also features a single-screen multiplayer. At any point of the game, a second player can join in. There is no online multiplayer present in the game.\n\n###Style\nThe game's art style is a mix between the Ancient Egypt mythology and cyberpunk. The music is also influenced by this mix.","id":9430,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6244,"name":"Black Wing Foundation","slug":"black-wing-foundation","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672c386f9cc8c463e3c0cd727dba899e.jpg"},{"id":3392,"name":"Holy Warp","slug":"holy-warp","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8ede101d19772775c1e9efb0ed91e58.jpg"}],"website":"http://holywarp.com/"},{"description":"","id":246478,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":26470,"name":"Koei Tecmo","slug":"koei-tecmo","games_count":149,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/637/6370d17534183a7cbcff7bb1878188a6.jpg"},{"id":12898,"name":"Intelligent Systems","slug":"intelligent-systems","games_count":68,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f668d9f7e4eba668e8307c048334cf.jpg"}],"website":"https://fireemblem.nintendo.com/three-houses/"},{"description":"Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, winner of multiple E3 awards as the best game in its genre, is the continuation of a saga that began in the award-winning The Longest Journey, considered to be one of the finest adventure games ever made.

The game takes heavy inspiration from the founder series of its genre, Super Smash Bros., and specifically its second entry, Super Smash Bros. Melee. Dan Fornace describes himself as a long-time fan of the Smash Bros. series, being the developer of the 2010 'de-make' fangame Super Smash Land.\n\nLike in Smash Bros., instead of a traditional fighting game arena, a game of Rivals of Aether takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked back when hit. The goal of the game is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied moveset. Two to four players can take part in the same game, in a free-for-all or a team battle. \n\nRivals of Aether differs from the Smash Bros. series in that, instead of having Smash Bros.' enormous amount of content, it puts heavy focus on its competitive aspect. The game features a tightly balanced roster of 14 characters (including 2 guest characters) and every stage has an unique variation designed for competitive play. The game pulls the roots of its mechanics from the second entry in the Smash Bros. series, Super Smash Bros. Melee, famous for its competitive depth and aggressive gameplay (many advanced techniques from different entries of Super Smash Bros. are present, such as wavedashing, Reverse Aerial Rush or moonwalking, and the game is balanced with them in consideration), and tries to improve on them while cultivating its own original dynamics ; among other things, the classic shield has been replaced with a parry, which can stun opponents if it succeeds, at the risk of a significant recovery period if it doesn't).\n\nThe game has gathered a decently-sized competitive scene and is ran along with Smash Bros. at various major tournaments such as Genesis or Frostbite, in addition of having its own championship series and other tournament series, primarily in the United States.\n\nAs all DLC characters for Rivals of Aether have been released, a Definitive Edition of the game is set to release in the future, on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and potentially PlayStation 4.","id":10397,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4397,"name":"Dan Fornace","slug":"dan-fornace","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8511e78126c3e9a9170488c4e94863_OpbDrMQ.jpg"}],"website":"http://rivalsofaether.com"},{"description":"Shelter 2 is a survival game, set in the tundra.

When they are strong enough to follow the lynx, they begin exploring the area and hunting. In the end, after becoming a grown-up, they leave their mother. \n \n###Gameplay \nAfter the birth of your cubs, you can name each one. There is a family tree, so the player aims to keep it going.\nYou have to protect the kittens. However, you should be prepared, that the death can chase them anytime. Sometimes the lynx has to fight enemies (wolves, eagles) and suffer from the natural disasters. As for the hunting, while progressing, the prey is becoming more prominent. In the beginning, it can be different critters, but then the mother lynx and her grown-ups kill dears. However, hunting is a bit limited in scope, because it includes only running fast and chomping. To do all these actions, you only need to beat one button. Overall, the mechanism is quite simple.\nThe lynx can bite, roar, sniff the air, break into a sprint, but each action needs only one button to press.

He is a powerful Judo fighter who must protect the integrity of Japanese Judo by performing at the martial arts competition. Following the recommendation of his surroundings to pray in the local temple, Gushiken finds himself in another dimensions and time — the prayer transported him in times of feudal Japan dwelled with fox-girls.

These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch?

Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles\nGame Phases\nNight\nThe night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity.\nDay\nThe day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial.\nDefense\nThe defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!\nJudgement\nDuring this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging!\nCustomization\nPlayers are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name.

The game is full of gross violence, black humor, obscenities, and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude, a typical \"white trash\" and a small town trailer-park dweller, as he is given menial daily tasks, such as buying milk. The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game, the player may piss over his opponents, use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat's anus), burn dogs alive, blow up cars (but not drive them, in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives), shoot people and flip them a bird. The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.\nThe gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player’s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series.

This game is the closest to the game Breakout.\n\n###Classic gameplay of the genre\nThe basis of the game is the same basic process as in the games listed above.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen is a “protected” by the player wall or a series of elements. A block consisting of \"bricks\" is approaching it from above.\n\nIn addition to this block, other elements can gradually approach the wall. Including, elements with own trajectory of movements.\n\nThe player controls a small horizontal platform, designed in accordance with the \"plot\" of the game - it can be an impersonal plank or something, stylized as a spaceship or anything else.\n\nThis platform is moved horizontally, right and left, within the boundaries of the screen.\n\nBetween the wall and the block of elements advancing on it, a ball is thrown, having sufficient elasticity to bounce off everything with which it comes into contact.\n\nThe task of the player controlling the movable bar is to be between the ball and the wall at the bottom of the screen - so that the ball never touches this wall.\n\nThe player manages his own bar, kicking the ball, and the ball is torn between the player’s bar and the block advancing from above, bouncing off the walls / edges of the screen, from the block and from other elements, if any, in the game.\n\nEach time a ball hits an impending block, it knocks out or otherwise destroys a number of elements that make up this block.\n\nThe player tries not to “throw” the ball to the wall behind him, because touching the ball to the wall will destroy it and either the game will end or the player will lose one “life”.\n\nIn addition, the player tries to knock out as many elements as possible from the block advancing on him - because the block’s contact with the wall also means the end of the game or the loss of “life”.\n\nWhen all elements / “bricks” from the block are knocked out, there will be no more block (but a new one will appear or the game will go to the next level).\n\nSimilarly, the player tries to do with other elements present on the screen - as a rule, they also threaten the wall and should not touch it.\n\n###Wisorb option\nIn this game, the classical scheme is supplemented with elements of the genres \"strategy\" and \"role play game\".\n\nIn the style of these additions, the player does not just beat the ball, but uses magic for this, between the levels the player needs to build cities and so on. The whole game is framed by a plot that adds interest and appeal to the classic gameplay.\n\n###Plot\nThe peaceful Kingdom of Gorudo has been faced with the threat of attack by hostile forces. This power is so great that only Cyrus is able to resist it, a wise man and wizard dedicated in a secret magic art called Wizorb.\n\nThe player is expected by numerous mysterious places / levels, from the derelict monster infested town of Clover to Gorudo Castle atop Cauldron Peak.

The in-game mechanics also allow the title to have non-zero replayability.\n\n###Interesting features\nPixelJunk Eden is the first game to support the PS3 trophy system natively — the other titles needed the appropriate patch. It is also the very musical game which is to be experienced through the artwork and sound design, not actual gameplay — Baiyon, the artist from Japan created all of the in-game backgrounds. The soundtrack and design have been largely contributed in by Dylan Cuthbert who has also created the sounds to the other PixelJunk titles.","id":5445,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","slug":"sony-interactive-entertainment","games_count":596,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6ac/6ac602e70c837ababdf025e997391d9c.jpg"}],"website":"http://pixeljunk.jp"},{"description":"The Wild Eight is in a constant state of improvement, and it is not yet complete.

The sniper wants the protagonist to complete quests around the town. These missions are quite humorous and include such tasks as fixing the town clock and shutting down a pornography store.

It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. \n\nIts plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.\n\nPortal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.","id":4200,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":1612,"name":"Valve Software","slug":"valve-software","games_count":42,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/328/3283617cb7d75d67257fc58339188742.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.thinkwithportals.com/"},{"description":"The hero of this game is a small tree that can independently travel, walk and jump, carry useful things in its backpack and do various useful things.

Escape mode requires the players to survive together as a team of up to eight players. They enter a level and try to complete a series of quests while fighting off an AI-controlled zombie horde.

This planning allows players to adapt, and use mechanics of stealth kills, ranged combat, wraith skills and head-on melee more effective.","id":11973,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":18893,"name":"Feral Interactive","slug":"feral-interactive","games_count":106,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0fa/0fadc446fd1e9ae9e23a32793d9a5406.jpg"},{"id":3813,"name":"Monolith Productions","slug":"monolith-productions","games_count":30,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4eaa50ded253689639fb29870e945d6a.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.shadowofmordor.com"},{"description":"GRIP is bringing old-school style combat racing back with a bang.

Still having consequences after being poisoned by the Joker and seeing visions with him, Bruce has to prevail the death of Gotham City.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics stays the same to the Arkham series.

Inspired by the classics from the “golden age”, and with an art style that mimics the aesthetic from the 90's arcade gems, this game pays homage to all classic gameplay features that makes this genre one of the best from its time!Details\nGenre: Classic 2D side-scroller beat’em up / brawler.\nNumber of players: From one up to three players local co-op.\nAvailable languages: English and Spanish.Features\nA lot of Combinations: Alternative paths, cutscenes and endings that can change based on the selected characters and your own decisions!\nFast and intense single-session gameplay: Each possible route in the arcade mode can be finished in less than one hour!

Are you good enough to get the Black Belt?\nDifferent Weapons: Each protagonist handles them in their own way.\nSpeedrun Timer: An exclusive in-game gadget compares current stage times against your best ones!

Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by “The Boss” in a world ruled by “the law of the jungle”.\nHowever, not everything is lost… two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!Main Characters\nGal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She’s an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don’t have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.\nRicardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He’s not very fast and his technique isn’t as good as his comrades’, but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He’s capable of destroying any enemy in record time!\nF. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He’s the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as “the forbidden technique”. While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.Credits\nAll the game (graphics, design and programing) was created by Sebastián García, while the full OST (composed of more than 40 great tracks!) was created by Gonzalo Varela.","id":46165,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":22160,"name":"sebagamesdev","slug":"sebagamesdev","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b253c3e79c3067d1683f59813c2f5efa.jpg"}],"website":"http://fightnrage.com"},{"description":"Mini Ninjas is set in a cartoonish version of medieval Japan and puts you into the role of a cute ninja. Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers. There’s no killing and no blood; defeating your enemies will only make them disappear and return to their natural shape. \nThere are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. \nThe game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The “chibi” (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes. There are also elements of Japanese mythology such as Tengu, the friendly magic bird people, who trade with the character, provide training, and offer quests.","id":4480,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":18893,"name":"Feral Interactive","slug":"feral-interactive","games_count":106,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0fa/0fadc446fd1e9ae9e23a32793d9a5406.jpg"},{"id":4132,"name":"Square Enix","slug":"square-enix","games_count":353,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d89/d89bd0cf4fcdc10820892980cbba0f49.jpg"},{"id":4033,"name":"IO Interactive","slug":"io-interactive-2","games_count":35,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe6a0050883ba3b7af9294fe700cba6.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.minininjas.com"},{"description":"The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural-noir murder mystery FMV game where you play as a detective who can shapeshift into other characters, allowing you to unlock secret conversations and private encounters.\nDorota Shaw is dead.

It is a part of Ubisoft reboot of the series that features the new setting, Ashan, albeit similar to the original Enroth.\n\n###Plot\nClash of Heroes takes place in the medieval high fantasy world. It is set 40 years before the events depicted in Heroes of Might and Magic V. The game follows five heroes. Two of them already featured in HoM&M V (Godric the knight and Anwen the elf), while three others are original (Aidan, who commands demons, a wizard Nadia and a necromancer Fiona). They oppose the demon lord who is searching for an artifact called Blade of Binding. He is going to use it to open the portal into his demon world and unleash his armies on Ashan.\n\n###Gameplay\nIn the campaign mode, the player assumes the role of one hero of his or her choice. Each hero represents one of the five traditional HoM&M factions (humans, elves, demons, wizards, and the undead) and has his or her unique roster of units. Heroes navigate the map in real-time, but the battles are turn-based. Like in HoM&M games, the heroes command their armies rather than fight on their own. The combat system, however, changed dramatically. In Clash of Heroes, it resembles a puzzle game of colored columns and rows. \n\n###Multiplayer\nThere are both local and online multiplayer modes that allow two players to compete against each other, to cooperate against AI or the other team of two players.","id":58896,"alternative_names":["Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes"],"developers":[{"id":405,"name":"Ubisoft","slug":"ubisoft","games_count":335,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/82e/82eeea65ebb047cc7f366faf2fb062b6.jpg"},{"id":1481,"name":"Capybara Games","slug":"capybara-games","games_count":9,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db5ab0d41a2a57274902d32ea8e6f1ec.jpg"}],"website":"http://mightandmagic.us.ubi.com/clashofheroes/"},{"description":"Hironobu Sakaguchi of Mistwalker brings together the talents of Takehiko Inoue, Kiyoshi Shigematsu, and Nobuo Uematsu to present the next generation RPG, Lost Odyssey.","id":29051,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":13843,"name":"Mistwalker","slug":"mistwalker","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f45fc726393361cafd9c6d33e3afa73b.jpg"},{"id":14180,"name":"feel plus","slug":"feel-plus","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec93b1f84bf2caf7f23daa8d90b47dc2.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"STEP INTO A PURE THRILLER IN WHICH NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS!\n\nAfter returning to the quiet streets of Paris to pursue a life of painting, Gus Macpherson could not escape his true art…\n\nThe former New York detective finds himself walking the beat once again, when hired by a sensuous woman to investigate the gruesome beheadings of her sister and brother-in-law.

It features a comically cartoonish visual style and deconstructs the genre's cliches and stereotypes. The game's main designer is Ron Gilbert, best known as the creator of The Secret of Monkey Island and other LucasArts adventure games.\n\n###Plot\nThe titular DeathSpank is the game's main protagonist. He is a larger-than-life masked champion of goodness on a quest to save the world. His goal is to find The Artifact, an object so mysterious that nothing is known about it: neither its shape nor its purpose. Nevertheless, DeathSpank and his companion, the bearded and robed wizard named Sparkles, believe this McGuffin to be critical. And so does their antagonist, the evil Lord Von Prong, who also searches for The Artifact. DeathSpank is one step from finding the elusive Artifact, but it slips away at the last moment. To complete his quest, DeathSpank needs assistance from local people, who, in return, send him on multiple side quests.\n\n###Gameplay\nAccording to Ron Gilbert, DeathSpank is a cross between Monkey Island and Diablo series. The game combines elements from action-RPGs and visual adventures. The combat system is essentially the same as in Diablo. The protagonist can obtain and use various types of weapons and armor and perform comb movements. There's also the Justice Meter that grows when DeathSpank defeats the villains. When it reaches the maximum, it buffs DeathSpank with a temporary power-up.","id":4903,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":109,"name":"Electronic Arts","slug":"electronic-arts","games_count":323,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/369/36914d895c20e35f273286145c267764.jpg"},{"id":11280,"name":"Hothead Games","slug":"hothead-games","games_count":48,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a9508d2aa27039e30a0d1b21f8a6a0f.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.deathspank.com"},{"description":"Raji: An Ancient Epic is an action adventure game set in ancient India. Raji, a young girl is chosen by the gods, to stand against the demonic invasion of the human realm. Her destiny to rescue her younger brother and face the demon lord Mahabalasura.\n---Key Features---\nBreathtaking Hand Painted Environment\nHand Painted art style\n\nEach and every corner of Raji: An Ancient Epic is hand painted, this utilises the use of several softwares, dedication and countless hours. The environment is inspired by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, which was the pinnacle of architectural achievement during the medieval era of India.\nThis inspired us and thus the art style naturally went down a route of hand painting each and every texture, which can be reflected in every pixel of the game. All thanks to our environment artist, since she comes with a Fine Art background and special expertise that suits the game.\n​\n\nUnique Character Artstyle\nReflecting Southeast Asia in an Indian game\n\nOur character art style reflects inspiration from Southeast Asia, the art team went to Bali, Indonesia to study more about the mythology and the background of the island. The art team were heavily influenced by the demonic statues and sculptures that were later infused within the characters of the game.\n​\nA Story Of Siblings\nA sister on a rescue mission, against all odds\n\nRaji: An Ancient Epic takes you through an intense and emotional story of Raji, who is determined to find her brother and bring peace to the human realm. The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic is a witness of how Raji evolves through the atrocities of war and the loss of loved ones. She takes upon herself to find an end to this reckless war, which can only happen if she manages to break down the might and the stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.\n\nGritty and Fluid Combat\nChoose your weapons and gods\n\nThe combat of the game offers a mix of fluidity in movement and attacks going against powerful and mystical enemies. The combat is empowering, making one feel like a demigod, but beware, her vulnerability as a human is never far away. The game offers you choices from various weapons as well as god powers gifted to Raji allowing for diversity and letting the player explore their own style of gameplay. Raji will also come across several demon types and subtypes, including mini bosses and epic boss battles.\n\n\nThrough the Ranks Of The Enemy\nThe bad and the ugly\nAll the demons in the game have their ranks among the army. While Raji can come across a demon from a specific race who gripped a stone mace, she might meet the same demon type later with full fledged armor and advanced weaponry. Not only that, one will come across well equipped demons, several subtypes with varying abilities and mini bosses that can be found lurking in the game.\n\n\nExplore Ancient Forts and Solve Environment Puzzles\nForts and Fortresses, secret locations, puzzles and environment storytelling\n\nThe story of the game takes you through various levels which were inspired by gigantic forts of the medieval era, built by Rajput kings of Rajasthan. Not only that these forts allow for tightly packed arenas for combat they also take the player through the massive scale and breathtaking views the forts provide. The levels will also feature secret locations where one might wonder, what would they stumble upon..friend or foe, treasure or trap?\n\nEach of the handcrafted levels will ask the player to surpass challenges one after another. Various “Mandala” puzzles play an important role in environment storytelling, these were designed to give the player a breather in-between the challenging combat. Certain level locations will be telling their own story, which is upto the players to decipher, our artists and level designer has made these locations keeping in mind the context of the level and the lore of the universe.\n\nMyths and Culture\nA grand game which inspires from Hindu and Bali mythology\n\nThe setting of the game allows us to seep in small fragments of Hindu and Bali mythology here and there. Various level locations, demons, bosses and characters will be representing distinctive features which draw inspiration from both Hindu and Bali mythology.

In Talisman, the player controls a single character and moves him or her across a map. There are ten characters, such as Assassin, Monk, or Elf. Each of them has a score of D&D-like abilities, such as Strength and Craft, as well as downsides. \n\nEach character has his or her set of consecutive scenarios that become longer and more difficult over time. The scenarios are sorted depending on the number of turns required to complete them. The player can set a record by beating a scenario in fewer turns.\n\n###Maps and movement\nEach map is divided into three realms that form concentric rings. The player starts at the outer realm and has to defeat guardians or build bridges and rafts to move inwards. The goal is to reach the center of the map, where lies the ancient artifact called The Crown of Command. \n\nThe character's movement depends on the dice rolls and the properties of the terrain he or she is on.

The tenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released in Japan in December 2002, in North America in March 2003, and in Europe in May 2003.\nThe game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea, a departure for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.\nThe Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but with a distinctive cartoon-like art style created through cel shading. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but the art style proved divisive among players, which contributed to comparatively weak sales. As a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next Zelda installment, the more realistically-styled Twilight Princess. However, The Wind Waker's reputation improved over time, and it is now widely considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The Wind Waker originated the \"Toon Link\" variant of the main character, and received two direct sequels for the Nintendo DS, Phantom Hourglass (2007) and Spirit Tracks (2009).

He goes on a vendetta after her murderers, hunting them down and killing in brutal ways. There's also a cooperative mode that features a different plot, something of a prequel to the main storyline. In co-op, Shank and the other playable character, Falcone, have to save a strip model from a gang of bikers and fix a rigged wrestling match.\nThe game is played as a fast-paced 2D side-scroller.

However, this monastery has disappeared for mysterious reasons. Sister Tabitha has to find it and, moreover, save the members of the crew. There is an encircling meta-story. Two reviewers called Shovelware Queens picked up the game's cart and give it a shot. As the player completes levels, they react to it. They appear at the beginning of the game, and you see them a couple of times during it.\n\n###Gameplay\nThere are four levels to complete. The gameplay is quite mixed, so it consists of the different genres. In the beginning, it is a top-down shooter. You have to shoot meteorites and also dodge them. Sometimes they drop to you Bible verses, which you can collect to raise the faith meter. There are two meters beside the faith: ammo and fuel. The ammo meter can be decreased by shooting, and you lose fuel while moving. Fighting foes decreases the player's faith meter. In a case of any meter's depleting you lose. The next level is a side-scrolling shooter, aimed at fighting enemies and killing the boss. As for the enemies, there are gnarled trees, mechs and spinning crosses. The last genre is a platformer. The player has to jump around to find Bible verses. You do not have to kill enemies, and there is no possibility to die.

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.\nIn 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map.\nThe human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.\nThe 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECTThe year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… \"SUNLIGHT\"EARTH 2150: LOST SOULSIt is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist.\nDevastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences.\nThe only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars.

Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it’s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system.

Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!\nPowerUps are back and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever!

He believes that going to the human world as a field reaper will enable him to one day meet her. Hence he’s taken the job of making sure people die and taught himself to dance to impress Betty.\nSince Felix only moves in the shadows, he needs to manipulate those shadows to move around. Luckily reapers like Felix are able to turn the sun and move shadowing objects, which enables him to create the necessary shadow paths to get around. He does so to solve the adventure plots, that makes people die according to the ministerial plans.\nEach level unlocks a hardcore version of itself for the striving ministerial achiever. You can also collect skull achievements, that further unlock bonus time trials for the extremely resourceful ministerial employee.\n•\tChallenge yourself to original puzzle game mechanics\n•\tExperience a gruesomely sweet and beautiful story world\n•\tChoose your own tune from a selection of 10+ indie music artists on Felix‘ Walkman\n•\tCollect skull achievements that further unlock bonus time trials\n•\tWatch Felix‘ dance moves develop as created by professional dancers\nFelix The Reaper has sprung from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. The history contains both The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden as two central themes going through it. We sort of mashed those two together in Felix The Reaper.\nFor the character himself and the world around him the inspiration was more diverse: in that aspect, the game contains inspiration from the ancient tv-show The Twilight Zone, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki.\nAnother important inspiration for Felix The Reaper were the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We've worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and historian scholars.The DanceSeveral dancers have been around throughout the production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves, that ended up in the game.\nHere's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:\nAnd here's Raphael doing another:\nThe MusicOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music - why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. That makes for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.The Art HistoryThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis and then asked ourselves: how can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here.\nParallel to the production a historical scholar has dived into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it in the game, if it fit. There's five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game, that you can unlock as you progress.","id":244784,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4988,"name":"Daedalic Entertainment","slug":"daedalic-entertainment","games_count":61,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c35/c354856af9151dc63844be4f9843d2c2.jpg"},{"id":101348,"name":"Kong Orange","slug":"kong-orange","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e267ccfe4e20b95815791ab391252b2.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.felixthereaper.com/"},{"description":"Explore and reshape distant worlds!

Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.\n\nOver the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.\n\n###Wheelchair with machine guns\nThe second game \"forgets\" about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.\n\n###Zombies give a second chance\nThe third game \"resurrects\" Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means.

The game is heavily inspired by Lemmings.\n\n###Plot\nAutumn is coming, the leaves become yellow and fall off the trees. The spirits of the fallen leaves go on their journey home.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players have to guide a group of fallen leaves spirits to a better place. The spirits can be commanded through changing the direction of the wind or building new paths. \n\nIt is possible to sacrifice the leaf spirits to build a bridge out of leaves, make a wind-blowing cloud, dig out tunnels, and block the winds. The players have to use that feature carefully as using all of the leaves will result in a player's defeat and the further restart of the level. It is up to you to find your own creative way of completing a level and get the leaf spirits to an exit off the level.\n\nThe game is specifically designed in a way that the determination and working out of your plan is much more harder than the plan's execution itself. There is a lot of moves that the spirits can execute, but are not as obvious as the players think they are. It is a process of trial and error for the players. \n\nThe developers put a heavy emphasis on the relaxing aspect of the game, as its color palette features mostly warm colors such as orange, red, and yellow and its soundtrack was specifically made a little bit silent to not distract the players.","id":17977,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4836,"name":"Spaces of Play UG","slug":"spaces-of-play-ug","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1f30c7eadac643a30c24ec77711f8ea.jpg"},{"id":2860,"name":"Spaces of Play","slug":"spaces-of-play","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b6b1b90c2023462310404f65564568a.jpeg"}],"website":"http://spacesofplay.com/spirits/"},{"description":"Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a stealth-action game developed by Ubisoft Toronto. It is the sixth main installment in the series.\n\n###Story\nThe game takes place six months after the events of Conviction. The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.\n\n###Gameplay\nSplinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.\n\nThe players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher's outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.\n\nThe game evaluates the players' performance.

With Dorfromantik, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life.

One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.\nOn some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up.\nAs you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.\nWhat Dorfromantik offersBuilding endless and beautiful landscapes\nUnique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics\nRelaxing and calming gameplay\nIdyllic village scenery\nStrategic placement to beat the highscore\nHigh replay value - every session is different\nMany unlockable tiles and biomes\nOriginal Artstyle with handpainted boardgame feelWhat Dorfromantik does not offer4X Strategy\nTrading\nResource Management\nCombat & Violence\nMultiplayer\nDorfromantik was developed by four game design students from Berlin.

As in many point-and-click adventures, the only interactions with the outside world include walking and examining objects to craft a new one and talking with non-playable characters.\r\nThe protagonist's gun also helps in solving some of the sophisticated riddles. There are many sections within the game, and one can travel through them using the navigator. In spite of the game features action scenes, it is impossible to die while playing — even if the player makes a lot of mistakes, the car collisions, for example, during the chases, would be cosmetic. There is a variation in dialogues — while presented with a options tree, one may choose the best suitable one. The choices affect subsequent playthrough.\r\n\r\n###Key features and plot\r\nThe game is set in a parodу universe where everything mimics pop-culture of a Western world. We play as Sam, who is a dog but walks and acts like a human. During the season, Sam and Max who looks much like a rabbit, solve the various riddles as a detective couple.

The game is inspired by the particle physics and the wave-particle duality.\n\n###Style\nWaveform is set to the background of space, filled with stars and nebulas. Occasionally, a familiar planet such as Earth will appear in the background, indicating that we are traveling through the Solar system. The game is accompanied by the electronic ambient music score.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe wave of light under player's control has a shape of a sinus curve. It serves as a route for a particle that flies forward through space. On its way, it will encounter other photons of varying colors that the player has to collect to set a higher score. \n\nThe game has around 100 levels of varying difficulty. The player will encounter a number of level features that increase the complexity of the game as he or she progresses. The dark matter is an obstacle to avoid. Mirrors reflect the particle, making it bounce back on its way. Some obstacles may even eliminate the particle.\n\n###Controls\nThe player controls the wave with his or her mouse. Moving the mouse left or right changes the wavelength, while up and down movements influence the amplitude. The player has to adjust the wave to navigate the particle along the route. Increasing the amplitude will also speed up the particle as it moves up and down on the screen. Meanwhile, its horizontal speed stays the same, in full accordance with the Theory of relativity.","id":16121,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":9137,"name":"Eden Industries","slug":"eden-industries","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5bba6cdb69d1b0fe7b28050f680f05.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Anna is a creepy horror game in which the protagonist researches the mystery of a haunted house.

The setting was modeled after a real place, and the story is inspired by the Alpine folklore. The player controls a man who lost his memory. He only can vaguely remember a sawmill and a woman called Anna. The protagonist visits the sawmill that is apparently haunted. He has to discover the uneasy secrets of his past and the fate of Anna.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player's goal is to solve the puzzles to move forward and uncover the mystery of Anna by recalling dialogues the protagonist had with her.

The game does not highlight the important items.\n\n###Extended Edition\nThe Extended Edition is a dramatically improved version of Anna. It was based on the feedback and criticism the original game received. This edition introduces a new AI-controlled character called \"The Wife Doll.\" It also adds letters, books and other documents that provide insight into the mystery.

The new titles were developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles. The two games hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.\nFireRed and LeafGreen are members of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games. As in previous games, the player controls the player character from an overhead perspective and participates in turn-based combat encounters. However, new features such as a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access have also been added. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises Pokémon for use in battle.\nThe games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.

This game features fighting entertainment with multi-tiered stages that are now both dynamic and critical parts of the competitive experience.\r\n[Story]\r\nThe story will follow that of Dead or Alive 5, shedding light on 2 main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the tournament “Dead or Alive 6”. New episodes will also be added for returning characters.\r\n[The New Visuals]\r\nThe visuals of DOA6 express dramatic lighting that goes beyond the genre of “fighting games” and focus on serious, intense combat. It also features improved skin and sweat textures, introducing wounds, as well as flexible, varied facial animations.\r\n[Triangle System]\r\nFights in Dead or Alive 6 are based on a Traditional triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. When you land an attack of one type that beats another type, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, that attack becomes a Hi Counter attack and does even more damage.\r\n[Break Actions - New Combat Mechanics]\r\nWith this title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, making the fights more strategic than ever before.

The first part of the move also parries attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move!\r\n[Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output.\r\n[Fatal Rush] Players can achieve unique combos by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. Beginners can even play by using this move exclusively, though its disadvantages will prove to be a calculated risk for more experienced players.[New Danger Zones]\r\n[Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy.\r\n[Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked into a large stack of nearby boxes with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush”, they will plow through them all in one hit!

Traditionally, the left stick accounts for aiming and the right sticks sets the direction of fire. Not only the robot can utilize the firearms, but the explosives alongside with other throwables are available. The customization takes place between the levels — upgrades may be found on the battlefield and present themselves as score points which may develop one of the robot's characteristics: shields, smart bombs, droid power or so.\nThere are forty levels in total, with every fifth being the assault one — the foes are more aggressive and unwelcoming there, and every tenth is a boss level. The goal of every level is to eliminate all the enemies and get to the end of the location. The title sometimes features the bullet hell elements — there are so many enemies on-screen, they start forming a distinct pattern recognizable as a picture.\n\n###Plot\nThe setting is near post-apocalyptic future, where the brains were taken out of the humans and implanted into the war robots, who fight their way to the humans left to defend them from their dreadful fate.","id":3340,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":325,"name":"Curve Digital","slug":"curve-digital","games_count":37,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f74addd8f5b5f83459c2cb700aaf4.jpg"},{"id":11517,"name":"Carbon","slug":"carbon","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7b2c1c2ffb15a99201c2d57b0de04bc.jpg"},{"id":8294,"name":"Puppygames","slug":"puppygames","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/953/953ecce8fe9a44264f432e113148c7c2.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.puppygames.net/ultratron"},{"description":"Mini Metro is an indie puzzle strategy game about building a rail transit network. You have to provide transport in continually growing cities by building stations, railways and disposing of trains. The number of passengers continually increases, and once any of the stations reaches its capacity limit, the game is over. With each in-game week, you get new trains and upgrades that allow you to upgrade stations capacity or give you additional tunnels, rail lines or train carriages.  \nEvery level in Mini Metro is based on the real city. Some of them have their unique features like high-speed Shinkansen trains in the Tokyo level. The game is notable for its minimalistic art-style. Almost every element on the level is made of simple shapes and bold colors. The different shapes represent different stations and passenger’s destinations. This style was chosen so it can imitate the real-life railway mar schemes.","id":2666,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":458,"name":"Playdigious","slug":"playdigious","games_count":26,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3f/c3f7d452a1657e756794fc1f421ab986.jpg"},{"id":28663,"name":"Radial Games","slug":"radial-games","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a5d9fbf7730702d28c75bec6f84f47.jpeg"},{"id":1284,"name":"Dinosaur Polo Club","slug":"dinosaur-polo-club","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d33aaeb43e5e520fb4b2e545e1662cf.jpg"}],"website":"http://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro"},{"description":"WipEout HD is a sci-fi arcade racing game developed by Sony Studio Liverpool. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe players use the futuristic anti-gravitational vehicles and participate in the FX350 anti-grav racing league. The game features all the previous tracks and vehicles from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse, which were released on the PlayStation Portable. \n\nWipEout HD is not a remastered game in a common meaning. It is more of a spiritual successor of the core mechanics that were introduced to the public in the previous installments of the series. \n\nFive modes are present in the game: a standard race, a Tournament mode, Time trials, Speed laps, and Zone Mode, where the players have to avoid crashing while their vehicle speeds up more and more. A photo mode is also available to the players. Photo mode is available at any point during gameplay, as it freezes the race the player participates in at the moment, allows to change camera position, and change exposure, lens focus or add depth of field.\n\nThe ships in the game feature four base stats: speed, acceleration, maneuverability, and shield strength. During gameplay, the players are able to pick up offensive or defensive weapons. Every weapon featured in the game was featured in the previous installment. For example, machine guns, missiles, landmines and so on.\n\n###Fury expansion pack\nFury expansion pack was released a year after the base game release.

It's a unique, atmospheric, single-player narrative experience, set in a rich, fully licensed, globally recognized universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.\nChoose your character from one of several distinct Clans\nEvery playable character offers unique powers (Disciplines), different ethical approaches to certain issues, and dialogue lines\nCharacter-oriented quests allow you to create your own coterie and shape your relations by reinforcing NPC loyalties\nHighly replayable - choices made in the game are reflected by the game's changing fiction\nVarious endings depending on your actions - which conclusion will you reach?\nSuitable for both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and fans of mature narrative-driven games who are newcomers to the setting\nThe game does justice to the mature themes of the World of Darkness, and takes advantage of the excellent atmosphere of the source material. It also creates new stories, which, thanks to the full creative license, will be incorporated as official lore of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.What is Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York?\nVampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York aims to translate the complex and fascinating world of vampires, their nightly struggles for power and attempts to hold on to their humanity, to a format previously unexplored by the brand - an atmospheric narrative experience. Think interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas, answers to which are entirely up to the players, allowing them to reach one of a variety of possible endings.How does Coteries of New York play?\nYou act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you’ll meet different NPCs – other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You’ll build your Coterie and learn your undead companions’ deepest secrets… or see them abandon you. You’ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity and will feel the constant lure of the Beast inside you. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You’ll be able to use Disciplines to charm, sneak, intimidate or kill and your choices will determine your path.If it’s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?\nYes, exactly! Coteries of New York is set in a fully licensed universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition! However, even if you know nothing about the setting, don't fret! The game is designed to meet the expectations of both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and new players, who never had an opportunity to delve into the World of Darkness.What about replayability and post-launch support?\nYou’ll be able to choose your character from three different vampires, representing three iconic Camarilla Clans (we’ll unveil them at a later date). Every character has access to a different set of Disciplines (unique supernatural skills that are characteristic to that Clan) and different narration. Your initial choice also influences your Coterie members’ approach to you, dialogue lines, possible side quests etc. Hence, it takes hours to experience every piece of content we prepared. You’ll go through the main quest, side quests and loyalty quests (aimed to build closer relations between the protagonist and members of your Coterie). BUT one playthrough is definitely not enough to see every piece of content we’ve prepared.\nAs for post-launch support, you can definitely expect new, standalone stories, enriching the lore, telling different bloody stories from the history of vampiric New York and adding new twists to interpersonal plots.Which platforms will Coteries of New York be available on?\nCoteries of New York will be available on PC (Windows, MAC OS, Linux) and Nintendo Switch. The game will launch on both platforms simultaneously. Other platforms, like PS4 and Xbox One, are not out of the question, but we're taking a \"wait and see\" approach.When will Coteries of New York be released?\nCoteries of New York will be released in Q4 2019! We’ll unveil the final date when we’re closer to launch.Which language versions will be supported?\nThat's a huge and very difficult topic because of localisation costs and time constraints. We understand that Vampire: The Masquerade has fans all over the world and we would like Coteries of New York to be available in many different languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese. We'll be able to share more information closer to launch.Will the game support controllers?\nYes! As Coteries of New York will launch simultaneously on PC and Switch, you’ll be able to play the PC version both with mouse and keyboard, as well as with a controller.

The main story is focused around their unwanted bond, and the game employs various mechanics regarding the control of two characters. Role-playing elements will allow the players to create a unique path for deuteragonists, and to find different ways to defeat their enemies. The game features lots of dialogue filled with witty humor, reflecting on the situation that our characters are in.\n\nDespite game’s premise of a simple hack-and-slash adventure RPG, the problematic caverns and long dungeons will provide a great sense of challenge even to the veterans of the genre, as the game punishes every mistake that the player makes.

It is a sequel to Max & the Magic Marker released in 2010.\n\n###Plot\nOne day, Max comes back from school and finds out that his younger brother Felix broke some of his favorite toys. Annoyed with his brother, Max looks for a way to get rid of him on the internet and stumbles upon a spell that is promised to make Max's brother disappear upon casting. When Max cast the spell, a giant claw comes through a portal and takes Felix. Max changes his mind and goes on to save his brother.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe core mechanics of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood revolves around solving puzzles that are solved using physics in a 2.5-dimensional world with a free player-controlled camera. There are 20 levels in the game which are divided into seven chapters. All the levels are tied together in a way they feel like one whole journey. \n\nThe main feature of the game's gameplay is a magic marker that adds a creative and open-ended approach to the game's puzzles. This marker is used to create material objects in specific places to use them to solve a puzzle. For example, the objects created by the marker can be used as a boosting platform to reach a previously unreachable spot and take a necessary item.","id":5717,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6683,"name":"Stage Clear Studios","slug":"stage-clear-studios","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc595cc6883458b42e0a5907cc6a3430.jpg"},{"id":137825,"name":"Bending Spoons Apps IVS","slug":"bending-spoons-apps-ivs","games_count":34,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/543/54370a1360c0765c692c6d5f0d604aa0_t3vh9OD.jpg"},{"id":24541,"name":"Flashbulb Games","slug":"flashbulb-games","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53a98929b8c944db6522487896fd9264.jpg"},{"id":975,"name":"Flashbulb ApS","slug":"flashbulb-aps","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/2037ec31218154645d501c413302754f.jpeg"},{"id":10057,"name":"Press Play","slug":"press-play","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51d1a050cab6b27285e258d993ac7f1.jpg"}],"website":"http://pressplay.dk/games/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood/"},{"description":"Play as Kao!

Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.\nThe Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\nIn a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.\nRichet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.","id":52330,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":25906,"name":"Big Bad Wolf","slug":"big-bad-wolf","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/123/123e035701a975f5d96c233f4048eed2.jpg"}],"website":"http://thecouncil-game.com/"},{"description":"In Watch Dogs Legion, you get to build a resistance from virtually anyone you see as you hack, infiltrate, and fight to take back a near-future London that is facing its downfall, courtesy of state surveillance, private military, and organized crime.\n\nRecruit a well-rounded team to overthrow the wankers ruining this once-great city.

The goal of most missions is to capture and develop certain planets on the game map.\nTo do so, you control your spacecraft fleet. Captured planets are not only strategically essential points and means to complete the mission, but they also produce Sollars — the primary currency in the game. You need Sollars for most of the actions that you can do in the game including upgrading your spaceships, planets, or even moving and dispatching your units. While conquering neutral planets is usually no hard task, you continuously encounter opposing forces (AI in single-player or other players in multiplayer) that also try to take over the planets and destroy your forces. The battles occur automatically, so the game’s primary challenge is in proper management and your fleet arrangement. There are several races available in the game, each of which has unique properties. After the end of each match, the fraction you chose would gain points that can be exchanged for ‘techs’ which give you passive upgrades such fleet strength or decreased time to upgrade planets.

The game is set on a faraway planet Apoxus Prime. The scientists explore its enormous caves to mine resources. The player controls a starship called Ers Pinita Colada. Its captain answers to a distress signal from Apoxus Prime and tries to rescue the scientists lost in the caves.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player flies the ship in the underground tunnels. The goal is to locate and save the scientists. The ship uses its gun to destroy enemies or to clear the way from ice and rocks. The ship has no hit points. Instead, a thermometer measures the ship's temperature. The player has to avoid overheating and remember to cool the ship, for example, by diving into water.\n\nThe underground features monsters, villains and other dangers. There are many environmental puzzles that require the player to manipulate water, lava, stones, and other elements to access the scientists and unlock doors. PixelJunk Shooter has three episodes comprised of five levels each, and levels consist of short stages. The player can only progress by saving the scientists, and if five or more of them die, he or she has to restart.

The players have to deliver cargo using the post-Soviet machinery deep in the Russian woods, where there are no solid roads and a lot of fallen trees.\n\nThe main feature of the game is dynamic terrain. That is achieved with Havok physics engine. Trucks leave marks on the road, get stuck in the terrain, which makes the further advancement harder.  Thanks to Havok, the terrain is procedurally generated every time the player loads a map. That adds a high replayability value to the game. This feature also makes the races against other players much harder, as you can't just win a race by going as fast as you can.\n\nIn SPINTIRES, the game focuses a lot on simulating the physics and behavior of the vehicles. Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car.\n\nThe players can also modify the cars using different attachments. It is possible to attach fuel tanks, repair kits, and so on.\n\n###Multiplayer\nThe game features a 4-player multiplayer mode, where the players can choose the time of day, and the environment. The objective of the mode is to reach the finish first without getting stuck in the mud.","id":14251,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":7748,"name":"Oovee® Game Studios","slug":"oovee-game-studios","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daa0e82d8b069e15c798cc794104d0d4.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.spintires.com"},{"description":"Workshop Level EditorEasily build custom levels with the powerful in-game Level Editor, then upload them to the Workshop with a single button.

It has very few differences from its predecessor, the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth.\n\n###Plot\nAnomaly Korea takes place in the future, after an alien attack that devastated much of the Earth. The invaders landed their ships on our planet and are protect them with heavy fortifications. The player assumes the role of a commander of an armored squad that tries to penetrate the alien defenses. As its name suggests, this installment of the series is set in Korea.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay didn't change much since the previous Anomaly installment. The player controls a group of armored units in real time. The number of units is limited, and there are no options to produce more, so the player has to keep his or her units safe. There is a limited number of boosts the player can use to improve a unit's health or attacks. \n\nAnomaly Korea includes twelve levels in its campaign mode. The primary goal of each level is usually to eliminate the defense towers that protect the alien base. One of the few notable improvements in Korea, besides better graphics, is the variety of its missions. They can include objectives like destroying a specific number of enemy towers or protecting a peaceful convoy on an escort mission. The game also introduces a new mode called Art of War that offers the player a set of more difficult missions.","id":2936,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3466,"name":"11 Bit Studios","slug":"11-bit-studios","games_count":22,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26a9d5a2e475df6a3f639417dad30d5a.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.anomalykorea.com"},{"description":"Midnight Club 2 is an arcade open-world racing game developed by Rockstar San Diego.

Each weapon has an alternate fire mode. For example, while using the alternate fire of a Stingray, a deadly energy beam is used instead of an energy sphere.\n\nThere are 13 maps present in the game, with one of them being a training map.

Each faction has a specific amount of power called “Imperium.” It specifies how many armies can a faction have and can be gained by conquering nearby lands and getting gold. After forming an army, it is up to the player to assign a general to it. Upon doing that, the general will recruit the soldiers for his army.

The owner of the St. George Cross, Violetta successfully fulfilled the tasks of the British special services. She was caught and killed in a concentration camp during the war. The player will go on a stealth adventure in the era of World War II and take control of Violette Summer, which runs deep behind enemy lines.\n\n###the story\nThe story tells of a girl from Dorset, Violette Summer, who lived happily with her family. But the war was all the same, and in the darkest times for the country, Violette joins the secret services of Britain. The game consists of secret missions and sabotages in which she took part. The action takes place in war-torn Europe: the agent is operating in Poland, Germany, and France.\n\n###Key features\nFrom gameplay the point of view, the game is practically no different from other representatives of the genre: from the very beginning, Violette will have to hide in the shadows in order to survive and move through levels. The user interface helps the player to navigate in terms of how visible his/her actions are: it shows the silhouette of Violette, which can be in three states - each one representing how well the agent is hidden. The game does not provide a complex combat system, but the ability to detect a rebuff to enemies is available. Also, players can upgrade agent’s skills on three branches: Stealth, Morphine or Strength.","id":19475,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":11176,"name":"Replay Studios","slug":"replay-studios","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e4636955975043351113a9efa9adc4ad.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.playvelvetassassin.com"},{"description":"Forza Motorsport 7 immerses players in the exhilarating thrill of competitive racing.

Its queen Catherine defends her homeland from invading dark forces. The game's seven campaigns allow the player to participate in this war on various sides.\n\n###Gameplay\nAI and human players take turns, each turn representing an in-game day. Each player controls cities, heroes, and units. The default victory condition is to eliminate rival players by capturing their cities. The story mode, though, has missions with specific plot-related conditions.\n\nThere are eight types of cities. Each type has a set of units and a unique style, based on a fantasy culture such as elves, orcs, demons or the undead. Any player can conquer and control any city. A player who loses all his or her cities is eliminated.\n\nA hero leads an army of units. Heroes explore the map, capture resources, fight enemies and neutral monsters. As they gain experience, heroes level up and obtain new skills and spells. Each hero has eight unit slots. Units of the same type stack and act as a single, stronger unit. During combat, units take turns on a hexagonal grid. \n\n###HD Edition\nA new edition, released in 2015, includes slightly improved graphics redesigned for modern monitors and tablets. Otherwise, the game is identical to its original version.","id":17620,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":405,"name":"Ubisoft","slug":"ubisoft","games_count":335,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/82e/82eeea65ebb047cc7f366faf2fb062b6.jpg"},{"id":85,"name":"DotEmu","slug":"dotemu","games_count":49,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/14357484e7aa013b19ed991cd5a1fadf.jpg"}],"website":"http://mmh3-hd.com/"},{"description":"Purgatory, Wyoming, 1888.

It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.\n\nIn Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as \"WADs\". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.\n\nThe Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.","id":52884,"alternative_names":["דום","دوم","ดูม","ドゥーム","毀滅戰士","둠"],"developers":[{"id":425,"name":"SEGA","slug":"sega","games_count":571,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7c9daceeb5701280e269588742b7aa.jpg"},{"id":343,"name":"id Software","slug":"id-software","games_count":83,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58da72d37b507d498de66e124c4e266d.jpg"},{"id":14196,"name":"Nerve Software","slug":"nerve-software","games_count":19,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bb0/bb04eabb272c7bd9e89e0321b5c47b86.jpg"},{"id":26548,"name":"Infinity","slug":"infinity","games_count":23,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91cc27fba94cea86fc3bdaa6eb1bb99b.jpg"},{"id":11308,"name":"Rage Software","slug":"rage-software","games_count":29,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/85338d1de80a4b52875e8283f81323b8.jpg"},{"id":14584,"name":"Logicware","slug":"logicware","games_count":9,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a509de267bad4c8f491b2d86f16934.jpg"},{"id":14451,"name":"Williams Entertainment","slug":"williams-entertainment","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/4019a58bbbe67f0f495431c062a79517.jpg"},{"id":11974,"name":"Sculptured Software","slug":"sculptured-software","games_count":58,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c9685dc0c18281969996ca86ec47358.jpg"},{"id":26188,"name":"David A.

The game is the continuation of the Tribes series.\n\nThe series includes games such as: Starsiege: Tribes, Tribes 2, Tribes: Aerial Assault, Tribes: Vengeance and Tribes: Ascend.\n\n###The general plot of the series\nThe plot of the series begins in 2471, when a scientist Solomon Petresun invents the first cybrid, a bio-cybernetic hybrid artificial intelligence named Prometheus. After this invention begins mass production of cybrids, which are intended to be used as slaves. However, in 2602 Prometheus grows and directs all cybrids against humanity.\n\n###Chronology series\nThe earliest events of this story occur in the game Tribes: Vengeance which was released in 2004.\nThe events of the next period are covered in the game Starsiege: Tribes, although the game itself came out before Tribes: Vengeance, in 1998. Then the story opens in Tribes 2, released in 2001.\nThe Tribes Aerial Assault, 2002 does not follow the events of the plot of the remaining games, although it is located within the general setting.\nFinally, the last game of the series today is Tribes: Ascend, released in 2012.\n\n###Terrain\nThe area in which the events unfold is very extensive. It consists mainly of hills, slopes and mountains. Anything else, such as buildings, is rare.\n\n###Player Classes\nAt the beginning of a match, each player chooses a character class. Classes are only three. Class can be changed during the game.\n\nLight class - health and weapons of this class are weak, but this class has a high speed, it can become invisible and attack at a great distance from the sniper rifle. He is the best if you need to steal a flag or catch up with those who have already done it.\n\nThe middle class is average in everything - in health, armament and mobility. But this is not only the average level of everything, it is also a good balance between all the qualities.\n\nHeavy class has the largest health reserve and powerful heavy weapons. Equally good in attack and defense, but moves slower than all, sluggish.\n\n###Special equipment and abilities\nAll three classes have a jetpack, allowing you to fly through the air. But the height of the climb depends on the chosen character class. All characters can slide on the surface, the speed of sliding is high, but depends on the mass of the character, and hence, on his class.\n\n###Modes\nTeam fight.\nCapture and retention.\nCapture the Flag, CtF is the main game mode.

However, the Chalice takes 300 years to recharge. The player's task is to hold on until the artifact reaches its full power. The Chalice has two souls that serve as the player's advisers.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player rules the kingdom using the world map in the Strategy mode and directly controls the units in the Tactical mode.

Some of the Cadence monsters that oppose the heroes have unusual attacks such as stealing the hero's XP points or aging the character.\n\nSince the player is immortal, the time is very compressed. The heroes eventually die of old age, which makes them disposable. The player has to breed new heroes and build dynasties by arranging marriages. There are three main classes of heroes: Caberjacks (heavy warriors), Hunters (ranged archers), and Alchemists (similar to wizards).

The story follows a Mexican runaway that does not remember anything about his past other than there is a bounty on his head. The game is notable for its art style that imitates pictures drawn with pen and paper. The game’s visuals are stylized, but the story bluntly describes the brutal nature of the late 1800s. The character himself is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, and some of the protagonist’s actions throughout the game are going to be far from honorable. \r\n\r\n###Gameplay \r\nThe gameplay is a top-down twin-stick shooter and shares some similarities with famed Hotline Miami series. The campaign consists of four acts that feature numerous missions centered on killing enemies as effectively as possible. One of the most notable characteristics of the gameplay is that you have to cock and reload your guns, using different buttons manually. The hero’s weaponry consists of iconic Wild West firearms such as revolvers, double-barreled shotguns, rifles, and bows. Between missions, you come across hub towns in which you can restock ammo, buy upgrades or take side-quests to earn more money. \r\nBesides the primary campaign, there is an arena mode that makes you fight waves of enemies.","id":13035,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6803,"name":"Ink Stains Games","slug":"ink-stains-games","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4dc/4dc01ea2a225682dc690cf517e7e09f6.jpg"}],"website":"http://12bt6.com/"},{"description":"The open world car racing simulator, part of the Forza game series, or rather the sequel to the Forza Horizon game, which was released in 2012.

This allows both the players and the developers to create highly interactive maps and even worlds of large scales. \n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players create their own character out of the same building blocks the whole world consists of. You are free to make whatever you come up with as long as it follows the community guidelines. The players can also edit their weapons the way they see fit. For example, it is possible to edit the basic in-game rifle into an M60 machine gun. The players can also choose a preset character model if they don't feel like creating something new.\n\nAfter that, the players are free to engage in multiplayer battles in one of the five game modes or launch up an in-game editor to create a new map or a so-called battlefield - a giant map, on which a match can be played for several hours.\n\nThe five game modes mentioned above are: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Assault, Castle Battle, and Hunt. Assault and Castle Battle can only be played on battlefields, as they require a specific map size. In Hunt, the players look for one of the players that have enhanced speed.

If you've been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you've just discovered it, \"stay awhile and listen\". The most commonly asked question is:What Kind of Game Is It?\nIt’s a very different game than anything you’ve ever played. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn’t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn’t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path – Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass – such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule.\nThe Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn’t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won’t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design.\nSo What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games?1. The Setup\nTraditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three's game critic):\n\"But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That’s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended.\"\nThe Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain.\nYou get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats.2. Combat difficulty\nAnother design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It’s a hard game.\nCombat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can’t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights.\nYou aren’t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we’re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you’re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you’ll end up dead before you can blink.3. Choices & Consequences\nChoices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you'll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable.\nStarting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin.\nThe questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default.

An enemy power has recently overthrown the local pro-American government. The player assumes control over the US special forces agents and Truenian rebels who fight against the new regime. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior, the player assumes the roles of several main characters, among them a US soldier Tyler Wells who performs sniping and stealth operations, and a local rebel El Tejon who is most useful in open combat.\n\n###Gameplay\nThere are several types of missions in the game. Some of them emphasize stealth action and marksmanship, while others involve direct firefight. Besides a variety of sniper rifles, the characters can use other silent weapons, such as knives and silenced handguns.\n\nThe game has a quasi-realistic model of bullet ballistics. The player has to take into account the distance to the target and the bullet's flight time. The wind and the shooter's physical condition also influence the accuracy.

There are more than 45 levels with different obstructions, enemies, and surroundings.\nThe player passes plenty of checkpoints on each level; it is possible to resume from there if they die. Every stage is covered in a particular color; some of them have portals, bridges, flying stairs, mazes, plants; some surfaces block the player's movement, or affect him otherwise. There are also moving levels that force the protagonist to move quicker. The character can run, jump and do the “smashing” movement - he then drops upon something directly.

Each level follows the same pattern: kill enemies, collect upgrades, kill a boss. However, there are many possibilities for a skilled player, as there are achievements to complete, and daily and weekly missions, which can have different objectives.\n\n ###Gameplay\nDying resets the game’s progress, while success opens up new mutations, weapons, and enemy types. There are five ammunition types, and many weapons share the ammo, so player often has to choose wisely. Mutations can be achieved through leveling up, with some available only to certain mutants, while others are free to choose from. Said mutations can emphasize on character’s unique skill, his weapon proficiency, or upgrade his stats.\n\n###Graphics and soundtrack\nThe game’s pixel art design is made very distinct and unique, as the setting of a post-nuclear western can lead to great possibilities for artists. Each texture, albeit simple, is recognizable and well-made, and the stylistics further emphasize the work of game’s designers.

You can pick any time period from between 1453 and 1789 and any country from a roster of 300. Despite the series' title, civilizations are not limited to Europe. \n\nThe country's current leader and state of affairs are generated on the basis of real history. Once the player enters the game, however, the events are randomized and only depend on the player's actions. A new feature introduced in EU3 is that the player can hire up to three court advisors (EU’s equivalent to Civilization’s “great people”). Each advisor has his or her area of influence and helps to improve the empire’s science, culture, or army. \n\n###Expansion packs\nContrary to its name, Complete edition doesn't include all of EU3 expansion packs (it is Chronicles edition that does), but only two of them: Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine. Napoleon's Ambition is set after the main game's timeline, lasts until 1821, and deals with the Napoleonic Wars. By contrast, In Nomine begins in 1399, and includes late medieval features like Byzantine Empire, Tamerlan's conquests, and the Hundred Years War.","id":19240,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4024,"name":"Paradox Development Studio","slug":"paradox-development-studio","games_count":56,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d119f8f6c5ff61ed458c44961e07efb6.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.europauniversalis3.com/"},{"description":"The game develops a setting common to the entire Uncharted series.

After the completion, each level could be replayed in a “realistic” difficulty or in a “Nightmares” mode (regular enemies are replaced with zombies).","id":906,"alternative_names":["Call of Duty: Black Ops 3"],"developers":[{"id":5833,"name":"Raven Software","slug":"raven-software","games_count":44,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e9c/e9c042d14515eb3ff7cb4db9fe78e435.jpg"},{"id":5734,"name":"Treyarch","slug":"treyarch","games_count":35,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce624eb18dc0bcebabbbd4200855771.jpg"},{"id":14196,"name":"Nerve Software","slug":"nerve-software","games_count":19,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bb0/bb04eabb272c7bd9e89e0321b5c47b86.jpg"},{"id":7891,"name":"Beenox","slug":"beenox","games_count":35,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b8a3aa7ceda9ef95eee1602c59265a4.jpg"},{"id":13874,"name":"XPEC","slug":"xpec","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec6eda0d3d08d023793486b253534c27.jpg"},{"id":17687,"name":"XPEC Entertainment","slug":"xpec-entertainment","games_count":14,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bb/8bb6d76e2948031e07ff38e1540cdc22.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3"},{"description":"Monsters in the yard.

The RPG element brings classes, skill trees, and looting system into the title. The available classes are warrior, mage, and thief.\nOne of the main focuses is on the realism — the game features a vast variety of deaths, for instance, death from frostbite if the character does not dress well; death from hunger in case the protagonist forgot to eat, and death from poisoning if the hero ate a suspicious flower in a middle of a woods.\nThe battles are not of the primary locus here — nonetheless, the system is simple and concentrated on hitting, casting spells and dodging in the appropriate time. \n\n###Plot\nThe player follows a storyline of a heroine who is destined to prevent Ragnarok — the death of all the living creatures according to the Norse mythology. The Valhalla stories, as well as the Tales of Nine Worlds here, are cleverly mixed-up with the postmodernist gags, forth wall-breaks, and even Harry Potter references.

Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n###The story and the setting\nThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.\n\n###Key features\nThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs.","id":19682,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":11327,"name":"Liquid Entertainment","slug":"liquid-entertainment","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/3516a96bfe412749304388e49e91ed2c.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.rise-of-the-argonauts.com/"},{"description":"Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition is an action-adventure game developed by Armature Studios. It is the direct continuation of Batman: Arkham Origins and is a canon installment of the Batman: Arkham series.\n\n###Plot\nThree months after his first encounter with Joker, Bruce Wayne comes across the Catwoman who stole documents from a secret government organization. She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison's staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages.\n\n###Gameplay\nUnlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania. However, the game does not use any features of such dimension and plays out like a usual 2D title. \n\nThe Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman's Detective Vision. \n\nWhen Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him. All the enemies, apart from bosses, require two or three hits to be knocked out. Most of the game's fights can be avoided by using stealth.

The player launches the ball to a diagonal table and watches as it randomly bounces back and forth. The player can only control the flippers in the lower part of the screen and uses them to prevent the ball from falling off the table. The goal is to hit certain elements with the ball to achieve a higher score before the ball falls off. Different tables have different layouts and may introduce additional rules, such as a player losing part of the score every time he or she loses the ball.\n\n###Tables\nThere are more than 70 tables in Pinball FX 2. Some of them are available from the start, and some can be downloaded for free, while others the player has to purchase. Each table has a theme to its design, such as Biolab, Buccaneer, or a popular franchise like Alien or Star Wars.\n\nThere's Operators menu that lets the player customize any table he or she owns. Customization includes allocation of table elements and special rules. For example, the player can adjust certain elements to appear only after a certain amount of points is gained.\n\n###Multiplayer\nPinball FX 2 includes several multiplayer options, both online and local.

The title revolves around the episodic series-like narrative and puts the importance of the player's choices forward.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game resembles the genre of the point-and-click adventures. The players can talk with non-mandatory characters and choose the dialogue options out of four or five alternatives. There is a heavy focus on the QTE — the sequences where one must mash buttons in time accordingly with the pictograms depicted on the screen. At the end of each chapter, the player is presented with the choice diagram — his of her picks are compared to those of the other players across the world.  \nIt is not to be forgotten — Minecraft: Story Mode is the TellTale adaptation of another video game. Fingerprints of this are clear: the crafting mode essential to the original has been added to the game, and the title has become more friendly all in all. That is the contrast with the previous TellTale installments — they were mainly targeting mature audience. \n \n###Story\nThe Story Mode created the narrative from the start — the original game does not feature it.

The boundaries of AI will is one of the main themes in the game’s story. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe game revolves around exploring environments, solving puzzles and sporadic fighting with different enemies. The gameplay incorporates elements of Metroidvania and point-and-click adventures. Some areas in the game require special items to access that can be found in other parts of the game world. One of the most notable gameplay mechanics in The Fall is that flashlight serves as a pointer. You have to highlight the items to interact with them. \nDuring combat, your flashlight turns into a laser sight. The player can use covers or blend into the background using camouflage. The enemies usually do not need many hits to kill the player. So most of the time landing accurate headshots is the best tactics to defeat enemies.

The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level.\n\n###Graphics and other features\nThe game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses.  The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies.","id":3628,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":22,"name":"Deep Silver","slug":"deep-silver","games_count":35,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4fb/4fb548e4816c84d1d70f1a228fb167cc.jpg"},{"id":4093,"name":"Keen Games","slug":"keen-games","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b488173f71caec3aadf43ae25b4083_yyL2vO6.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.sacred-world.com"},{"description":"The only driving force in this game is the curiosity of the player.\n\n###Unusual game\nIn the game there are no goals set explicitly and in advance, there are no videos telling anything, there are no monsters with which it is impossible not to fight. Nevertheless, something constantly happens in the game, and what happens in it causes both curiosity and consequences - especially, depending on what you do in the game.\n\nFor a start, you can go through a very briefing and then step into the world of the game to explore everything by yourself.\n\n###Unusual setting, unusual gameplay\nThe character of the game is a small man, alone in the whole space of the game. He is surrounded by blocks of different colors. Blocks grow like trees or duckweed on the surface of water. They can even be planted with seeds, just like plants are planted.\n\nEach seed after planting in the \"soil\" germinates differently. As a result, you are always surrounded by growing “bushes” or “fields” of blocks that live their own and special lives.\n\nIt seems that these seeds and blocks speak to you in their own language. Understanding this language and learning how to interact with “plants” is one of the tasks of the game and the condition for success in it.\n\nBut all this time, another dimension of the game world is slowly destroying the very ground on which you stand. It destroys your world, because everything in it rests on this soil.\n\n###Clear answers\nIt is noteworthy that everything that happens in the game has its own logic and can ultimately be clarified definitively and definitely. But until that happens, the player may feel ignorant and even confused.\n\n###Individuality\nThe path to understanding all of this is individual for each player and to a significant degree it is the player who determines what this path will be. The player determines this by his actions, his manner of reacting to what is happening in the game.\n\n###Goals and story\nThe game still has some goals that the player must achieve. But even the discovery of these goals is based on the fact that the game causes the player curiosity and in the process of satisfying this curiosity the player comes to both understanding the goal and the decision whether to reach this goal or not.\n\nThere is also a kind of plot, a story in the game. But this story is represented by fragments scattered throughout the game world.\n\n###Music to relieve\nTo relieve the tension that may arise from the difficulties of the game, music that accompanies the gameplay helps well.","id":19353,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":11175,"name":"Droqen","slug":"droqen","games_count":71,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bd2aa09c7af51600ad0d56529f191f.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.starseedpilgrim.com/"},{"description":"Start your own cult in a land of false prophets, venturing out into diverse and mysterious regions to build a loyal community of woodland worshippers and spread your Word to become the one true cult.","id":650605,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":21727,"name":"Massive Monster","slug":"massive-monster","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fd8e54c2d0d77ef16ff26ff8bec2440.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.cultofthelamb.com"},{"description":"Forza Motorsport 3 is an auto simulator game developed by Turn 10 Studios. It is the third game in the Forza Motorsport franchize.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe main game mode is Season Play. The players are given three events to choose from, which consist of three to five races at the beginning of the game. On the last day of the second week, a championship takes place. Each season has more and more season races. \r\n\r\nForza Motorsport 3 has a car class system that depends on the Performance Index. 11 performance classes are present in the game. Performance Index is calculated by evaluating the car's base stats, such as Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Launch, and braking. The Performance Index can be increased by buying car upgrades or decreased if the car's weight gets bigger or the players decide to switch the drivetrain.\r\n\r\nThe players can create completely custom designs of their vehicles and later upload them to the internet. It is even possible to record videos through the in-game photo mode and upload them to the Forza Motorsport 3 website. \r\n\r\n###Multiplayer\r\nThe game features a competitive multiplayer mode, which pits eight players against each other on any track available in the game. The multiplayer lobbies are fully customizable, which allows for creating both realistic races like an actual 24 hour Le Mans marathon on Circuit de la Sarthe or teaming up together for a fun drift session.","id":29131,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":14256,"name":"Turn 10 Studios","slug":"turn-10-studios","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bd4/bd4ab8c94e52fb6d2da185ecca8f6c45.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Super Animal Royale is an intense, strategic and ridiculous twist on the battle royale genre, with exotic biomes and murderously cute animal characters, all vying to reach the top of the food chain.\nAtmospheric battle royale action from a whole new top down perspective.\nGet the jump on your opponents using a unique line of sight fog of war system that enables sneaking and close combat fighting.\nAdventure through a massive, beautifully illustrated island, filled with diverse biomes and topography.

The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.\nDevelopment began in 1995 at Millenium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan. The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as Windows and the Sega Saturn, Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of Halloween themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.\nIt was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, MediEvil 2, in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled MediEvil: Resurrection. At PlayStation Experience 2017, a remaster for PlayStation 4 was announced.","id":57596,"alternative_names":["MediEvil: Yomigaetta Gallowmere no Yuusha","MediEvil: Yomigaetta Garomea no Yuusha"],"developers":[{"id":18869,"name":"SCE Cambridge Studio","slug":"sce-cambridge-studio","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f11/f112a2c28322e38b2b3ecf5755f9313a.jpg"},{"id":26098,"name":"Guerrilla Cambridge","slug":"guerrilla-cambridge","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/814239fb75b49765c330fc4be4cdbf1b.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Beware the shadows and the darkness which seem silent. Beware the closed doors, the whispering mirrors. Beware the Song of Horror that nests in the cracks of your mind.\nThe famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family.

The players control a small platform that is used to kick off the beats that come from the right side of the screen. The game initially released for the Nintendo Wii, so its gameplay is well-adapted for Wii Remote. The players can control the platform by tilting the remote. \n\nEach level consists of three phases: Transition, Descent, and Growth. Each of them has a difficulty increase, compared to the previous ones. There is a boss fight at the end of each phase. The only way to complete a level is to kill the boss or to get a game over.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is created by the noise that the beats make upon hitting the platform. Each deflected beat gets the player several points. The beats move in various patterns making it hard to hit them back. There are also several special types of beats present in the game, such as the beats that pause on the game field for several seconds. \n\n###Multiplayer\nBIT.TRIP BEAT features a multiplayer mode for two to four players.

Seven greatest mages sealed the monsters underground and left one entrance through a hole in the Ebott mountain. A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out.\n\nUndertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on. As the game goes on, the player has to solve several puzzles and interact with NPCs. The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back. Monsters behavior depends on the player's actions: if one decides to use a peaceful approach it will be easier to dodge the enemies attacks and vice versa. \n\nThe game features a branching story and several endings. The ending the player gets depends on whether they spared or killed the monsters they encountered throughout the game.","id":13627,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":28889,"name":"8-4","slug":"8-4","games_count":16,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db83a83c7fc09dca7d5357ed28d167dd.jpg"},{"id":13342,"name":"Toby Fox","slug":"toby-fox","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be0643ff060109f0adca42a44f227640.jpg"}],"website":"http://undertale.com"},{"description":"One of the most popular games of the 2010s, Minecraft allows you to rebuild the environment around you. The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist.","id":22509,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":313,"name":"Mojang","slug":"mojang","games_count":15,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c14/c146d28ceb14c84ea9fdbd7410701277.jpg"},{"id":13984,"name":"4J Studios","slug":"4j-studios","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/8456392f2c08a07e07f3e6e1d4619c58.jpg"}],"website":"https://classic.minecraft.net/"},{"description":"Sam & Max 201: Ice Station Santa is the first episode of a graphic adventure game Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space based on self-titled media franchise.

It takes place one year after the event of Sam & Max Save the World. The story begins with a giant robot attack on their office. After the heroes defeat the robot, they find out it was a present from Santa Claus, so they decide to travel to the North Pole where they discover panicking Santa who barricaded himself in his workshop and threatens the elves with firearms. Sam and Max decide to find out the reason for Santa’s distress as well the cause of the robot attack. \n\n###Gameplay\nJust like the previous game, Sam and Max Beyond Time and Space is a point-and-click adventure with a heavy emphasis on story and comedy. Throughout the game, you explore different locations, solve puzzles, interact with other characters. Although the core gameplay is identical to Sam and Max Save the World, there are some new features in the sequel.

The hunt for Shadow Client and his militia takes Agent 47 to new locations, such as a motor race on the sunny streets of Miami and a deadly tropical rainforest in Colombia.\n\n###Gameplay\nAs usual for Hitman series, the player controls Agent 47 from the third person view (switching to the first person when using sniper rifles) in a 3D environment.

It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's Entertainment Computing Laboratory under the Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship.\nAfter research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful Kickstarter Campaign allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety here.\nAndrew Cross is infuriated!\nFor three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the \"SanjigenJiten,\" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International.\nBut while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted!\nBut Andrew Cross has a plan.

The game was created in 1986 as a parody of a real sport and for a long time existed in a desktop format. The primary goal of the game is to deliver the ball to the enemy's score-zone. You can do this in two ways: to run into it or give a pass. The turn lasts until the player performs an action by all the characters.\n\nThe Legendary Edition includes 20 races, 11 of which appear in the game for the first time. Each race involves unique gameplay. Matches take place in the form of a crazy mix of turn-based combat and a sports simulator. Players noted the high difficulty of the game and its dependence on a successful dice roll: even the most simple move can fail due to a bad throw. In the career mode, the player is encouraged to start building his own team from scratch, buying new players, cheerleaders and additional coaches.","id":11751,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4815,"name":"Cyanide Studio","slug":"cyanide-studio","games_count":66,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c44b5bc1923d26c200c311fd997f4e33.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.bloodbowl-game.com"},{"description":"Powered by Unreal Engine technology, the “modern and masterful side-scroller” Shadow Complex became an instant classic when initially released in 2009, exclusively for Xbox 360.

He attempts to exit the house, but a mysterious voice from the phone screams insults at Anthony and tells him where to find the exit. Tony follows the clues and leaves the house.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main gameplay mechanic is based on exploration. Like in most escape room games, it is necessary for the players to look for clues in the environment they are in at the moment. Further into the game, the levels are no longer set in a house, but in a park with the landscapes of it being used for several puzzles. \n\nFrom level to level, several gameplay mechanics change with the only gameplay element that stays the same is the character movement or item interaction. Everything else is subject to change. These gameplay elements can be used as a puzzle piece in several levels, but most of the time they create an obstacle for the player to pass.\n\nThe developers put a heavy emphasis on the fact that gameplay mechanics were meant to be experimental and unpredictable. This effect is achieved by avoiding the use of the “What you see is what you get” principle. There are multiple unexpected turns present in the game. For example, at some point of the game, the players have to jump down a ledge. It first it appears that the main character will fall to his sudden death, yet it appears to be the right direction to move to.","id":15824,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":8915,"name":"Creability","slug":"creability","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a45a954fb8ece200923ee8194e4c7072.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"El Presidente is back!Features: Play on large archipelagos for the first time in the series.

These included 2.5D reboots of Golden Axe, Altered Beast, and Streets of Rage, as well as an endless runner version of Shinobi, all encompassed in a universal hub world.\nSadly SEGA Studios Australia’s doors were shuttered in 2013, and with it the SEGA Reborn project was lost to the annals of video game history.\nUntil now.\nOn the occasion of SEGA’s 60th Anniversary, as a special treat to say “Thank You!” to our fans, SEGA is releasing a working prototype of Golden Axe Reborn, a single level created as proof-of-concept, or what’s known in the industry as a “vertical slice.”  We’ve dubbed it, tongue in cheek, as “Golden Axed.”\nGolden Axed offers a unique glimpse into the prospect of a project that could have been, and a rare peek behind the curtain at the sometimes tumultuous world of video game development.\nWe reached out to some of the original development team to bring this dusty gem to light, and they are proud that this project could be revived in some form to be shared with you, the fans.*Available until 10am PST / 6PM BST October 19th*","id":507154,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":425,"name":"SEGA","slug":"sega","games_count":571,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7c9daceeb5701280e269588742b7aa.jpg"},{"id":213246,"name":"The Eccentric Ape","slug":"the-eccentric-ape","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7c9daceeb5701280e269588742b7aa.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.sega60th.com"},{"description":"Sky Force Anniversary is a vertical shoot-em-up game developed by Infinite Drems Inc. It is heavily inspired by the old Japanese arcade machines, like the ones made by Capcom.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players have a plane that they use to attack their enemies head-on, evading return fire. Multiple planes are present in the game, with each one of them having their own stats and gameplay. Every player will be able to find their favorite pick. \n\nThe primary objective of each level is to get to its end without getting blown up by enemy planes, as most enemy shots are fatal. The levels consist of a mix of challenging and easy moments with the difficulty rising with each encounter. There are several boss fights present in the game. There are also several side objectives. Usually, there are four of them: destroying 70% of the enemies, 100% of the enemies, saving all the people present on the level, completing the level without getting any damage.\n\nSky Force Anniversary features a very balanced economic system. The players are awarded stars upon destroying an enemy plane. These stars serve as an in-game currency. It is used for upgrading your plane or purchasing new ones. The amount of stars awarded to the player depends on the chosen level difficulty.\n\nUnlike the previous title, Sky Force 2014, Sky Force Anniversary is not a free-to-play title. Thus it does not rely on microtransactions in its gameplay.","id":1374,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":9248,"name":"Crunching Koalas","slug":"crunching-koalas","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec2814d3b70f84c35714d9e2faa3656.jpg"},{"id":717,"name":"Infinite Dreams","slug":"infinite-dreams","games_count":18,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c02198cb96f8c1979c4753f6b5d82933.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.idreams.pl/our-products/show/product/76-Sky-Force-2014"},{"description":"Fate has summoned you to the shores of Aeternum, the Eternal Isle.

Once again, Sonic must halt Dr. Robotnik’s plan on collecting six Chaos Emeralds and using their power to take over the world. This time, Robotnik build a space station called Death Egg and the events take place mostly on West Side Island. The game also introduces Tails – Sonic’s best friend and important character for the series. \n\n###Gameplay \nGameplaywise the game is very similar to its processor. The game consists of eleven zones.\nAll zones, except the final one, are divided into two or three acts. In each act, your goal Is either to reach the finish of the level or to defeat a boss. The gameplay revolves around Sonic’s ability to run at high speed. The levels involve many objects that help Sonic gain high speed such as slopes, loops, and springs. Sonic can attack enemies and break certain obstacles by using Spin Attack. Like in previous game Spin Attack activates by gaining high speed while rolling on the ground or jumping but Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduces new gameplay mechanic – Spin Dash. Pressing down and jump while stationary results in Sonic curling in a ball and then upon releasing the button launches launching forward at high speed.

It renders the F1 racers as wacky characters and their cars as karts.\n\n###Style\nThe game features drivers, teams, and races from the 2012 season of Formula One. However, unlike most simulators, which aim to represent the races realistically, F1 Race Stars is a humorous arcade game. The racers, such as Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton, are depicted as cartoonish versions of themselves. \n\n###Tracks\nThere's a total of eleven tracks based on the real Formula One circuits. They retained their basic configurations but were enhanced with springboards, loops, traps, and other unrealistic features. The circuits' backgrounds also became comical representations of a country where the race is set in.\n\n###Gameplay\nAlthough the game is a kart simulation, F1 Race Stars doesn't imitate the actual karting, either. It provides a fictional combination of karting and Formula driving experiences. The cars in the game cannot drift and slide. Instead, the game uses the real-world KERS system to give the car a boost when exiting the corner. The game features power-up in the vein of Super Mario Kart, and some of them are parodies of the actual Formula One elements, such as a safety car. Each team in F1 Race Stars also has a special ability, such as shooting at the opponents for Ferrari or a free boost for Red Bull.","id":4183,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3543,"name":"Codemasters","slug":"codemasters","games_count":98,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/882/8820b0bc5ec9c135aca22389d105b566.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.f1racestars.com/"},{"description":"The Games on Demand version supports English.

Stop Thieves quickly, with a swing of your sword or a zap of a lightning spell! (Or maybe both, if you’re really bloodthirsty.) Price your wares competitively and great adventurers will travel from miles away to your one-stop shop to spend their gold – the gold that they probably found conveniently placed on a cave floor! Shoppe Keep delivers deep gameplay mechanics in a memorable, tongue-in-cheek world.\nGone are the days of testing the theoretical water – we’re now a fully-fledged, fully-opened store! Despite reaching full release, developer Strangefire will continue with our planned seasonal updates – after all, we all know that Shoppe Keep is the true meaning of the holidays - but the especially fantastic news is about the brand new Inn!\nThis building has been blocked off for some time, and many have speculated that it will be an Inn – well, the sneaky players were right! The Inn is best used at lower levels and a lower gold count. For a small amount of kPoints, you are able to unlock the Inn with a single table for four guests.\nAn inn with a single table? What complete rubbish! Additional tables can be purchased by speaking with the innkeeper, as well as additional upgrades that will help your Inn deliver serious coin. Adventurers traveling through town might want to visit the Inn and enjoy some food and ale – if they haven’t found some randomly laying around on their travels already. We all know that fantasy worlds cater for their heroes – but with Shoppe Keep, you’ll be able to make sure that catering doesn’t equal ‘potato in a toilet’!\nVarious members of four completely original and never before seen character classes will visit your store, including hardened warriors, magical mages, sneaky rogues and wise druids. (As you can tell, we’re taking this description text VERY seriously!) Each of these character types will seek to purchase items relating to their unique skill set - a warrior will be hard-pressed to take a flimsy magical robe into close quarters’ battle, for instance! Mages, however, will be perfectly happy with a wooden stick. It’s ‘magical’, or something ridiculous those absurd mages believe. Will you be able to accommodate for all four classes of customers?\nYou have a completely unreasonable clientele to add pressure to your role as a Shoppe Keeper. After a day of heroism, beating up goblins and even battling the great ol’ Dragonclaw, your customers can be just a little short-fused. This means your displays can be spoilt and your tables may be damaged by angry customers! The renegade ‘heroes’ are not too worried about bringing in dirt from the street either!\nHowever, help is at hand! As the owner of the store you’ll be armed with various exciting tools for combating these issues. The mighty wooden broomstick will sweep away dirt brought in from your customers, and the great hammer will repair furniture damaged by these ‘extraordinary’ visitors. A few sweeps and a couple of swings means that your shop will be in tip-top shape. Grow your business, and you can employ an army of ‘Helper Bots’ to take care of this for you – the cutting edge in imaginary technology that totally exists.\nSet your prices too high and your customers may think twice about investing their hard won (or stolen) gold in your shop. They’ll take the plunge and attempt to steal stock right under your nose! With no CCTV available in ye olde world of Shoppe Keep, you have to rely on your combat skill! A sharp swing of the sword or the zap of a magic spell can make quick work of these pesky Thieves. But be cautious not to hit any innocent bystanders or you’ll suffer a monetary penalty, as well as a life riddled with guilt! Not to mention the hideous moral conundrum of whether or not to tell your family or- look, just don’t kill innocent people.\nAnd let’s not forget the ferocious Barbarians! They live on the outskirts of the city, looming like an ancient race of organic-synthetic hybrids that invade the gal- wait, wrong game.\nRegularly invading the town, Barbarians will cause as much damage and destruction as possible! They will even fight you directly if you try to stop them. Eliminate a few dozen Barbarians and they’ll invite a much… larger friend to come and visit you. But what will you do with all the bodies? Unless you wish to display the corpses as examples to your customers, you monster, you’ll need to use either the broomstick or the grinder.\nIt’s tough running a shop (especially one that may or may not be the venue of a murder-fest); there are not enough hours in the day to go out and procure new items for yourself. Thankfully, you can employ a Champion, unlocked via the skill tree. Select a class, equip the Champion with your finest armour and weapons, and send them out to bring home rare new wares. Despite that awful half-rhyme, some of these items can be sold, some are junk and others can be crafted into more powerful gear.\nYour Champion will need to gain experience, just like the fantasy heroes you’re familiar with. During their first outing, they may fall in battle (and regret not saving more recently!), and whilst they will not return with any new goods, the experience will have taught them valuable skills that will improve their chances next time.\n‘Helper Bots’ are your robotic staff team. The MK III charts the latest iteration of this tech, increasing the artificial intelligence of this mechanical chap. We all knew that true AI technology would be created before CCTV – it was inevitable.\nThe ‘Helper Bot’ has three duties; zapping Thieves who attempt to steal from your shop, picking up items that customers may have thrown to the floor, and restocking items back on the shelves. You can purchase several ‘Helper Bots’ to, well, help run your shop.\nMake a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy worldFEATURESMake a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy world\nManage your own Shoppe, from ordering stock to setting prices\nDesign your own Shoppe layout by ordering tables, shelves and weapon racks\nThe world of Shoppe Keep reacts to your every Shoppe decision, including prices and stock quality\nUnlock new abilities and perks in the skill menu, including alchemy, harvesting, and the capability to own a grinder and a high tier stock.

The battlefields of the 31st century are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units known as BattleMechs. Piloting these war machines are the most elite soldiers that the galaxy has ever known. To most, they are known simply as MechWarriors.\nYou will assume the role of an elite MechWarrior, fighting for supremacy over the galaxy against other players.\nQuick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.\nIn Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.\nGameplay\nPiloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle.\nNext Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.\nMake Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.\nFight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.\nTeamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.\nInformation Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role.\nFind the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.\nChoose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.\nGet Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.\nCertain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.\n'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.\nMechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.","id":11163,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":14178,"name":"Piranha Games","slug":"piranha-games","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ba2/ba27ddbd28606e4ef8f694298c0fd67f.jpg"}],"website":"https://mwomercs.com/"},{"description":"Craft The World is a unique sandbox strategy game, the  mix of Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress.\nExplore a random generated world populated by dangerous creatures, build a dwarf fortress, gather resources, and craft all the items, weapons, and armor you need.\nGOD-SIMULATION\nYou control a tribe of dwarves by giving them commands to dig in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other structures. You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases.\nSANDBOX GAME\nEach game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands.\nCRAFTING\nOne feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves.\nRTS\nAt the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break into the dwarves’ residence.\nTOWER DEFENSE\nEspecially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to build a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways.\nMAGIC\nAs a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters’ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants.","id":10198,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4196,"name":"Dekovir Entertainment","slug":"dekovir-entertainment","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/77917f8e96e9bad5e85b6cf9e3415908.jpg"}],"website":"http://dekovir.com/craft-the-world/"},{"description":"Dustforce DX is the updated version of Dustforce, a platformer game where you need to clean up the world of dust.

From the genre of the shooter from the third person the game took a powerful action in the entourage of several visual styles - comics of the 50's, neon lights of the 80's and 90's, cold dynamics of the 00's. Much in the design of locations is a quote or allusions to famous works of science fiction of the fifties.\n\n###Instead of the invasion of the Reds, an invasion from the Red Planet\nMars invades the US with its iconic 50s-styled flying saucers, insectoid drones, various robots in the size of a skyscraper, rolling balls that turn into death machines on stilts, floating bombs, iconic 50's-styled flying saucers. The aliens are rolling in waves, from different directions.\n\n###Sci-Fi archetypes\nCharacters that can be played correspond to the chosen style of pulp-sci-fi, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.\n\nYou can play on behalf of one of the characters, but you can also unite with others, and this will give the most guaranteed victory.\n\n###Gameplay\nYou can fight in different ways - attack the aliens, personally shooting them, or building a network of defensive structures. When building, you can use money, sell unnecessary.\n\nYou can alternate the way of action - to run and shoot, and then to build something and so on. Of course, in this situation, there is no time for deep strategic calculations, so the strategic part of the game is not as elaborate as in the games of the strategic genre itself.\n\nThe canon of the genre tower defense is presented in the game much more fully - there are quite useful tools, a great variety of units. For defense with weapons, the player has the soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades, gun turrets, weapons that freeze and fire the enemies and so forth.","id":3238,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":8514,"name":"Clapfoot","slug":"clapfoot","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d4787c3d42848def5f1c229b644c21a.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fortifiedgame.com"},{"description":"LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is an action-adventure utilizing LEGO thematics and mechanics.

Hence, Multiwinia is all about gameplay, not the plot or visuals.\nYou control a tribe of Multiwinians, who look as small, static, vaguely human-like silhouettes. Each tribe is distinct from another in color only. There are six modes, each with its own conditions of victory; those are Assault, Blitzkrieg, Capture the Statue, Domination, King of the Hill, and Rocket Riot. Some of this modes require Multiwinians to capture certain points on the map or to destroy a specific enemy unit, such as a weapon of mass destruction. Each mode allows both a single-player game against the CPU and a multiplayer for up to four players. The controls in Multiwinia are innovative and somewhat unusual yet intuitive. A  WASD-controlled camera is meant to allow a variety of views on the map.","id":12318,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":2112,"name":"Introversion Software","slug":"introversion-software","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f4f0bc79ea2f3decb7601d26088e3d8.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/"},{"description":"Minit is a peculiar little adventure played sixty seconds at a time.

The levels rotate when the airship moves right or left and scroll when you fly up or down. Each level ends with a boss fight. \nEliminating enemies is the main objective in Resogun, but there’s also an optional objective to save the prisoners from their cages. Rescuing humans earns the player additional points, which is essential to set the high score. There are three modes: the Arcade mode, in which you simply pass through the consecutive levels; the Single Level mode, in which your goal is to obtain the highest score on a certain level; and a cooperative multiplayer for two.

The game features realistic weapons, vehicles, ballistics, animations, character damage, and the world's landscapes. There are no health points in the game. The players can get killed with 1-2 shots unless they wear body armor or heal their wounds in time.\n\nThe game came bundled with a level editor which gave birth to a dedicated community and allowed for the creation of countless custom scenarios and levels.\n\nThe game features a multiplayer mode in which other players can drop into your game seamlessly and either play with or against you.","id":19932,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3461,"name":"Bohemia Interactive","slug":"bohemia-interactive","games_count":42,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2ecf055ac9339d3a58808842c44a9b7.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.armedassault.com/"},{"description":"Purchase this PS one® Classic and play it on both your PS3™ and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) systems!\n\nThings are heating up!

The player controls a trading cog from the top-down view. He or she navigates the vessel through the seas, uncovers new areas and completes quests and tasks. Most of the tasks are simple and require the player to travel between cities. The ship can carry passengers and cargo to gain money and to fight pirates to gain influence. The goal is to profit from the trade, eventually to join one of the factions and help it to assume control over the new ports. There's no semblance of a plot.\n\n###Ship management\nThe player can upgrade his or her ship to expand the cargo space to earn more money, as well as to increase its firepower and stamina to withstand battles against pirates. The combat system in Windward is simple. When the player's ship approaches the enemy, it fires its cannons. The player has no direct control over the cannons. However, he or she can manipulate the ship so that to take a better position and lure the enemy into a trap.\n\nAs the player progresses and gathers more money, he or she can hire other ships to serve his or her faction. They can form fleets to attack and capture enemy cities. However, the player still only directly controls the original ship.","id":14589,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":138723,"name":"Tasharen Entertainment","slug":"tasharen-entertainment","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fefb9cd7cedb7bf1c2e69f159edb1272.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"When humans get too lonely, they turn into monsters.\nThis adventure is about Kay, who has turned into a monster and her journey to find out what happened to her.\nOn her search to change, she soon finds out that her biggest enemies are not the huge monsters that she meets on her way through the Sea of Solitude, but something way more dangerous.","id":58736,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":109,"name":"Electronic Arts","slug":"electronic-arts","games_count":323,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/369/36914d895c20e35f273286145c267764.jpg"},{"id":28057,"name":"JO-MEI GAMES","slug":"jo-mai","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/22a/22a3b2ddb5b344b1081cc28768f8ac84.jpg"}],"website":"http://seaofsolitude.com/"},{"description":"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is an upcoming game about traveling, sharing stories, and surviving manifest destiny.

It is set in an alternate version of the 20th century Lithuania. The Alliance of Free Cities was created by the Rothschilds. Alchemists perform their research, and inventors fly their steampunk airships, mechanics create robotics. The story follows a former United States Marine Antanas Sidabras, who lives in the Free City Of Vilnius and investigates a murder. A major conspiracy comes up during his investigation.\n\n###Gameplay\nAntanas Marcelionis was the illustrator of Hour of the Wolf. The game inherits the same steampunk-induced visual style. The objective of the game is to fly your air balloon over multiple obstacles that will destroy it upon making contact. There are two ways of blowing the balloon. The players are able to either use their left mouse button to inflate the balloon or yell into the microphone if they have one (this is the default control scheme in the game). \n\nThe players can also control the wind flow with the arrow keys. The game's world is highly interactive, so it is possible to get more speed and elevation using chimneys and steam pipes. The game heavily relies on physics and wind simulation, as the players have to avoid sharp obstacles, mines, and all other sorts of hazards.\n\nTrailers:\nhttps://youtu.be/jolcjHcUDMM\nhttps://youtu.be/-29qlNLapgU","id":16117,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":9133,"name":"Antanas Marcelionis","slug":"antanas-marcelionis","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/271458a145626b16058f3023308be3fb.jpg"},{"id":9134,"name":"Renė Petrulienė","slug":"rene-petruliene","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/271458a145626b16058f3023308be3fb.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.howler.com/"},{"description":"NBA 2K14 is the ninth installment in the 2K series of basketball simulators.

It also features a variety of online multiplayer modes.\n\nThere are two new modes introduced in NBA 2K14. The story mode, called \"LeBron: Path to Greatness,\" was inspired by Jordan Challenge mode from the NBA 2K11. It follows an imaginary version of LeBron's career, in which the players control LeBron in a sequence of matches. The other mode, Training Camp, is a tutorial mode that allows the players to get used to controls\n\n###Changes from previous games\nNBA 2K14 didn't change much since the previous parts of the series. Besides the aforementioned new modes, there are a few slight additions. The AI was improved to become less predictable, especially while defending. The controls now include a pass assist option that allows the players with the perfect timing to perform precision passes. The game introduces European league teams, although they do not have a separate mode.\n\n###Soundtrack\nLeBron James has personally selected the playlist for the game. It includes mostly hip-hop music by artists such as Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z, and Eminem, but also a few pop-rock songs by Imagine Dragons, Coldplay, and Phil Collins.","id":3855,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":383,"name":"2K","slug":"2k","games_count":59,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/884/884e6a520b60aac011a38f4954303448.jpg"},{"id":4497,"name":"Visual Concepts","slug":"visual-concepts","games_count":81,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eb2/eb299a5235932d21d32e1f8da06043dd.jpg"}],"website":"http://2ksports.com/games/nba2k14"},{"description":"\"Bendy and the Ink Machine™\" is a first person puzzle action horror game that begins in the far days past of animation and ends in a very dark future.\r\n\r\nPlay as Henry as he revisits the demons of his past by exploring the abandoned animator's workshop of Joey Drew Studios.

It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.\nAt Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form.\nKey Features\n14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.\nIncludes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!\nA story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.

The core gameplay is a tower-defense.\nYou have to fight waves of enemies strategically placing turret-like towers. There are several types of towers with different properties. Some of them have splash damage or can slow down enemies, while others deal more damage to certain types of aliens. You can upgrade towers increasing their damage.\nAdditionally, each tower has two elemental variations: fire and ice. You gain money by killing enemies and spend them to upgrade towers, get power-ups, or building points which are necessary to build new towers. The chief gameplay mechanic of Commando Jack is that you can manually control any tower from the first-person perspective and shoot aliens by yourself. This help is killing enemies faster, and some alien can only be defeated this way. Aside from the 45 missions’ campaign, the game offers the Elemental Mode in which you have to defeat fire and ice enemies with different element towers. The mobile version of the game is free-to-play and includes microtransactions, while the PC version has a price and uses only in-game currency.","id":8813,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":3104,"name":"Colossal Games","slug":"colossal-games","games_count":2,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e07924ded75d710f406d0c4447af3c62.jpeg"}],"website":"http://colossalgames.eu/games.html"},{"description":"America’s Army Proving Grounds is a free military game provided by the U.S. Army. The game is a part of America’s Army series. \n\n###Plot \nThe player performs as an infantryman, a part of a Long Range Combined Arms – Recon unit. The plot is based on the U.S. intervention in the Ostregal Islands as a call for defending the RDO Government which was struck by the Czervenians. The U.S. forces landed on the Islands to engage in police action and reconnaissance operations. \n\n###Gameplay \nThis is a classic first eye tactical shooter. The player is given certain tasks to perform as a part of the unit.\nThe aim is to stay alive in campaigns and fulfill each task. It is possible to change the character’s appearance even though the customization system is quite small. There are a few weapons including M4, M16, standard sniper rifle and shotgun. Maps are not too huge which makes it easier to go through a match. The maps vary in landscapes and size. Each one provides its benefits: it is possible to hide behind the trees in the forest mode or hole upon the earth in the field. The player is free to choose the very own tactics, be it the perfect stealth, merging in the terrain, or be it the classic get-through shooting campaign. The gameplay includes medical help; if the player is injured, it is possible to bandage yourself or wait for help.","id":9457,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":132278,"name":"U.S Army","slug":"us-army-2","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1c3/1c3bcb76d03f320824ea7638cddddb6c.jpg"},{"id":3420,"name":"U.S. Army","slug":"us-army","games_count":3,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b35380b60558f112f57d4f95227d5ac8.jpg"},{"id":21299,"name":"US ARMY - ARMY GAME STUDIO","slug":"us-army-army-game-studio","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b35380b60558f112f57d4f95227d5ac8.jpg"}],"website":"http://americasarmy.com/aapg"},{"description":"RUSH is a 3D puzzle game developed by Two Tribes. It is a remake of WiiWare title Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush. \n\n### Art-style  \nThe game’s art-style is very reminiscent of other Two Tribes title – Edge. It is extremely minimalistic. The levels themselves are mainly made of white cubes, and the other object is simplistic and colorful, and are mostly just geometrical shapes. \n\n### Gameplay  \nThe game consists of more than 70 levels. Your goal is to guide multicolored cubes to a certain spot on the level throughout the multi-layered levels; the game world is fully 3D.\nTo do so, you have to place individual tiles over the cubes’ course. They affect cubes’ direction and speed. There are also special tiles such as teleports. Each level has several entrance point and exits for the cubes of different colors. Some of them can have special objects like conveyor belts that affect cubes’ behavior. After the player places the tiles, they can press the button to start the movement of the cube. From this point, the player cannot affect them, and if any cubes collide or fall from the edge of the level, the stage restarts.\nThe main concern for the developers was the maximum simplification of the controls so the player can focus on the puzzles alone, so all the movements in the game may be performed with the sole mouse.","id":12725,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6529,"name":"Two Tribes","slug":"two-tribes","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2ded05ff3b23be65612fd80d30668a2.jpg"},{"id":1985,"name":"Ketchapp","slug":"ketchapp","games_count":132,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/8141fdf0500911939a1de18dd17f4d04.jpg"},{"id":464,"name":"The Binary Mill","slug":"the-binary-mill","games_count":16,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/461c9f9b25dc10d0918a89e1ff505967.jpeg"}],"website":"http://www.twotribes.com/rush"},{"description":"1872, with a steampunk twist.

It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.

Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as \"Active Time Event\" cutscenes, \"Mognet\", and unique equipment and skill systems.\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater.

In 2015 it was remastered as Castle Crashers Remastered and was released for Xbox One.  \nYou play as a knight sent by the king to defeat an evil wizard who stole the king’s daughters and captured and mystical gem. The gameplay is very reminiscent of older side-scrolling beat-em-up titles. It can be summarized as a player has to defeat waves of enemies in different locations using his weapons and magical abilities. However, it also incorporates some role-playing elements such as acquiring gaining new levels which allow a player to enhance his stats and acquire new moves. One of the gameplay’s focal points is cooperative multiplayer with the support for up to 4 players which is available both locally and online.  \nThe game shares significant Behemoth hand-drawn visual style which was used before in Alien Hominid and would be later used in studio’s BattleBlock Theater and Pit People.","id":4954,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":1686,"name":"The Behemoth","slug":"the-behemoth","games_count":8,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/504fa26f3174c87083391963b949834f.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.thebehemoth.com"},{"description":"In a one-color world, one scholar, working in one of the universities, suddenly discovers the phenomenon of color. But where she works, nobody needs her discovery. And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum.\n\nThe player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors.\n\n###Game mechanics based on color\nIn the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game's background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, \"open\" some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated.\n\nThere are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning.\n\n###The Mysteries of the Final\nIn addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.","id":758,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":325,"name":"Curve Digital","slug":"curve-digital","games_count":37,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f74addd8f5b5f83459c2cb700aaf4.jpg"},{"id":100230,"name":"Serkan Binici","slug":"serkan-binici","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d20069544d04b810745febcd7b3ad466.jpg"},{"id":9868,"name":"Fiddlesticks Games","slug":"fiddlesticks-games","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f74addd8f5b5f83459c2cb700aaf4.jpg"},{"id":153824,"name":"Fiddlesticks","slug":"fiddlesticks","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f74addd8f5b5f83459c2cb700aaf4.jpg"}],"website":"http://huethegame.com"},{"description":"The game takes place in Paris, during the Great French Revolution, from the capture of the Bastille in 1789 to the Thermidorian coup.

This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  \nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features.","id":18241,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":6288,"name":"Ninja Theory","slug":"ninja-theory","games_count":19,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a7263e0ccaf879a00296db0d6d91c854.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.devilmaycry.com/"},{"description":"Dead Space 2 is a third-person action shooter including both survival and horror elements.

And the matter is not so much in the capabilities of the language, as in your capabilities - after all, you can find a variety of solutions for the same problem. For example, instead of “writing” a high-speed car for yourself, you can “write” a passage to the right place - even if it is separated from your “reality” for many kilometers.\n\n###Big Play\nHowever, the game is not about harmless entertainment - a group of hackers who are at war with the government agency Ministry comes in contact with Sebastian.

In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.\n\n###Plot\nThe player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.\n\n###Gameplay\nHatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game's world and plot.\n\n###Endings\nThe game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.","id":3253,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":436,"name":"Devolver Digital","slug":"devolver-digital","games_count":61,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b2/0b240149610b8b20eac098b8071f575a.jpg"},{"id":2470,"name":"Mediatonic","slug":"mediatonic","games_count":13,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/81e/81e5cf3f433473af3a04888e3baceeba.jpg"},{"id":10026,"name":"The Irregular","slug":"the-irregular-corporation","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da9fbc08b1b468e84f9414f386c2d262.jpg"},{"id":10027,"name":"Hato Moa","slug":"hato-moa","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81a9759dfc8860376ae29fc3fb5ca122.jpeg"}],"website":"http://www.mediatonicgames.com/hatoful-boyfriend"},{"description":"Super MNC is a free-to-play third-person MOBA game developed by Uber Entertainment. It serves as a direct sequel to Monday Night Combat. The game is not playable as of May 24th, 2018 due to GDPR.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game puts two teams of 5 players against each other. A class-based mechanic is featured in the game. It heavily depends on teamwork as the players have to choose their character right after getting assigned to a team.\n\nThe game features a mix of class-based combat, tower defense style game, and a typical MOBA. The main objective of either team is to destroy the so-called Moneyball of the opposing team. In order to complete the objective, the players have to get through the turret defense, which can only be destroyed by sending out bots on a specific lane. Once the bots get to the turrets, their shield goes down, and the turrets can be destroyed.\n\nThe players are awarded money and experience for every kill they make. Experience is used to level the player's character up and unlock character-specific skills. The money can be used to summon new waves of bots or purchase temporary powerups at vending machines. \n\nThe game also features a survival mode called Super Blitz which puts five players against the in-game announcer. The players have to defend their Moneyball as the Announcer sents waves of bots to destroy it. The Announcer takes a break every ten rounds which can be used to repair turrets, build new ones or upgrade your character.","id":15659,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":622,"name":"Uber Entertainment","slug":"uber-entertainment","games_count":6,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20ec6440ede691638c42684fd6551156.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.supermnc.com/"},{"description":"The Mad King Ludwig demands castles!

The slogan of the game “What happens when the DLC practices go too far?” describes the main concept: there are more than 30 different DLC in the game, which open access to such things as character animation, the ability to move and so on. Each mechanic and every function that is considered a basic in an ordinary game here is hidden by an independent developer under the lock of additional content, which must be bought for the coins collected in the game. Perhaps the industry has gone too far in pursuit of profit and has forgotten what games are in the first place? The developer is trying to answer this question through the monotonous grind for abilities and power-ups.\n\n###Key features\nThe player takes control of the nameless protagonist, who must save the princess.

His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason.

By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up.

It allows the player to race a series of challenges to receive a better car as a reward. 26 locations include famous real-world tracks, such as Hockenheimring and Indianapolis. There's also a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players\r\n\r\n###Changes from previous games\r\nThere are several differences between Forza Motorsport 4 and its predecessors. One of the most notable is the automatically adjusted difficulty. The game keeps track of the user's score and abilities and alters the AI and speed of the rival drivers accordingly. Another new feature is that the player can choose the prize car he or she receives.\r\n\r\nThere's also a new option called Autovista. In this mode, the player can explore a car in details, both inside and outside of it, including the parts not usually seen. Autovista provides the user with information about certain parts of the car through the voice messages. There are 24 cars that the player can observe in this mode.\r\n\r\n###Controls\r\nBeing an Xbox 360-only game, Forza Motorsport 4 allows the player to use Kinect as part of the controls. When included, Kinect can control either the vehicle or the player's vision. In the former mode, the game uses automatic acceleration and deceleration, while the player steers an imaginary wheel. In the latter mode, Kinect tracks the player's head movements to let the user look left, right, or back.","id":28460,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":14256,"name":"Turn 10 Studios","slug":"turn-10-studios","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bd4/bd4ab8c94e52fb6d2da185ecca8f6c45.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-US/games/fm4"},{"description":"KurtzPel is a 3rd Person, Anime-Inspired, Action Battle Game created by KOG, the developers of Grand Chase and Elsword Online.\nYou can enjoy various 2vs2 PvP Modes queued up by a smart, automated match-making system.\nOr, you can embark upon a larger-than-life, raid style, quest driven battle system against big, bad boss monsters.\nIn KurtzPel, classic action game dynamics are enabled when players empower their characters with 2, separate jobs (Karma) that can be used interchangeably.Main Content\nPromotion Mission(PVP)\nDeathmatch (PVP) - Defeat your enemies and whoever scores more points will win.\nCapture the Flag (PVP) - Acquire the Flag in the battlefield and whoever scored the most point at the end of the match will win.\nConquest (PVP) - Split to Red & Blue team and whoever has captures the zone when the match is over wins.\nEpic/Repeat Mission (PVE)\nFight important enemies in the KurtzPel universe and discover the story of KurtzPel by interacting with Hero NPCs.\nAlso, has a low chance to drop special reward (Accessories and etc.) and has multiple difficulties and provides challenges in PVE fashion.\nCharacter Customization System\nSelect your personality and provide appearance options depending on your selection to lessen the difficulty of selecting your character’s appearance.\nYou can select body type, height, and other appearance feature to create your unique character.\nKarma (Weapon) Switching System\nThere are two roles, breaker and slayer.

Gameplay-wise, it’s a regular 2D shoot ’em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks.\nWhat makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player’s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot ’em up. Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness.

This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.\n\n###Plot\nThe plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks.

The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.\n\n#Plot\nU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.","id":56184,"alternative_names":["Biohazard 4"],"developers":[{"id":3678,"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom","games_count":429,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/974/974342a3959981a17bdbbff2fd7f97b0.jpg"},{"id":17,"name":"Capcom U.S.A","slug":"capcom-usa-inc","games_count":87,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/106/10679840f87dba8f493612d9d542d566.jpeg"},{"id":17756,"name":"Capcom Production Studio 4","slug":"capcom-production-studio-4","games_count":10,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a008c45d5576f04249e775c9e2d1ac.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.residentevil.com/4/"},{"description":"You play an Uplink Agent who makes a living by performing jobs for major corporations.

The player uses the DM to set up the battles with monsters and then leads the party members as they crawl through the dungeons in a fantasy world.

It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\r\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.","id":881,"alternative_names":["FH 3","FH3"],"developers":[{"id":13141,"name":"Playground Games","slug":"playground-games","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/786/7863e587bac630de82fca50d799236a9.jpg"}],"website":"https://forza.net/horizon"},{"description":"Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians is a rhythm-adventure centered around following the beat while traveling through levels.

The game, released in 2007 is considered the first in the series.\n\n###Key features\nThe action takes place in the fictional Pacific City. The player is given control over the biologically improved Agent. The agent is the representative of the Agency, it was called to Pacific City because of the sudden increase in crime. The main task is to eliminate three criminal bosses and organized crime syndicates: Los Muertos, The Volk and Shai-Gen Corporation. In order to get to the very top and overthrow every villain, the player will have to travel around the city and defeat the first level of the criminal hierarchy: thieves and bandits. Each gang is assigned its own district - so capturing an offender in one area leads to the next level in the hierarchy of one of the gangs. Having defeated the kingpins the player can challenge the head of the criminal organization.\n\n###Game mechanics\nThe game is typical for the third-person-action set in a sandbox environment, like the games of the Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row series. Like other ones in the genre, Crackdown uses a huge set of cold weapons and firearms. As well as various skills and skills that you can upgrade: for example, for more distant jumps on the roofs, hijacking cars and studying the entire game world. For upgrading it is enough to accumulate the necessary amount of Experience Orbs.

You are a soldier of the resistance, an air force pilot who joins the attack.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Revolution Ace bares a close resemblance to classic top-down scrolling shoot-em-ups with several key additions. For example, the players are free to modify their plane as they see fit since a progression system is present in the game. You start off with a simple plane that can be equipped with new weapons and armor upgrades.\n\nSince air, land, and sea enemies are present in the game, the plane that is piloted by the player is already packed with several air-to-land missiles and machine guns. Over 20 weapons are available for the plane. It is also possible to equip perks to obtain passive bonuses, such as an improved armor shielding or piercing bullets.\n\nUnlike in classic shoot-em-ups, your armor does not go down with the first shot it takes.

He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him.

You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not \"good\" anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the \"evil\" motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.","id":18886,"alternative_names":["Overlord 2"],"developers":[{"id":7930,"name":"Triumph Studios","slug":"triumph-studios","games_count":14,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e99c6f892346d04f74c4c5df8c101aa.jpg"},{"id":10211,"name":"Virtual Programming","slug":"virtual-programming","games_count":7,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bfb/bfb2bf7a0413443b1fcf0be7c3244053.jpg"}],"website":""},{"description":"Carefully constructed horror game relies on positioning, camera work, and shocking content.

The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we’re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it’s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:\nNo story whatsoever - we don’t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho <3\nIf you’re not looking for an incomplete game that’s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you’d rather just play a finished experience that’s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.\nHowever, if you’re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren’t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we’re now ready to start this adventure together again. We’re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let’s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What’s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it'll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you’ll get the full expansion for free once it’s finished and released.\nHowever if you can’t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we’ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who’s still new to the franchise.FAQ\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven’t played the original SUPERHOT?\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It’s lots of fun.\nWhat’s the update roadmap?\nWe’re new to Early Access, but we’re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we’ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.\nI really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?\nThe discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We’ll tap into your creative hivemind. We’ll put your ideas into life.\nYour mind will make the system stronger.

Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.\n\nAlex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings.

At first, it all started with the usual hooligan antics, beginning with a slingshot and ending with the theft of the gramophone. However, one of the gang members decided to attack the mayor, infecting his brain with parasites. The mayor manages to call the robot scavenger that will send the bandit to a dump. However, the scavenger by mistake sucks the cleaner Joseph (you play as him). And the bandit washes off, kidnaping Joseph's girlfriend, Berta. From this moment the game begins. \n\nThe most significant difference from other games made in this genre is that the interaction occurs only with those objects that the protagonist can reach.

The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R.

In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.\n\n###Key features\nIn the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.\n\n###The changes\nThe main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.","id":884,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":5833,"name":"Raven Software","slug":"raven-software","games_count":44,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e9c/e9c042d14515eb3ff7cb4db9fe78e435.jpg"},{"id":11,"name":"Activision","slug":"activision","games_count":164,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1cc/1cc86be85294d9d3cf2fc95d696ce819.jpg"},{"id":7891,"name":"Beenox","slug":"beenox","games_count":35,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b8a3aa7ceda9ef95eee1602c59265a4.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.callofduty.com/modern-warfare-remastered"},{"description":"Real-time strategy genre has always been about domination over your opponent, and Civilization in general expanded on the concept.

The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nBattlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.\r\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class.

Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!\nPlay as the Counselors!\nWe all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!\nCamp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!\nMirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey.\nPlayers will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!\nYour Crystal Lake Database\nFriday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you'll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies!

Developers abandoned the mechanics with a number of lives players have for every walkthrough and until at least one of the party is alive, he can revive the rest. The action takes place in the 17th century: the British Empire colonized Mars. The decent story plays a secondary role, the main focus on gameplay.\n\nThe game includes wild intensity, handcrafted visuals of the classic arcade and an insanely flickering screen like in Japanese bullet hell games. Developers used real Roanoke Colony and its inhabitants as a reference and animated films of Hayao Miyazaki as an inspiration.\n\nThere are 4 types of ships in total, each with two attacks: the primary one and the secondary one. There are 20 additional steampunk levels available for players to complete, which even those who have never played bullet-hell will like. The soundtrack and careful work on visual styles put gamers into a trance and creates an illusion of full immersion in the world of the game.","id":40936,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":10568,"name":"Final Form Games","slug":"final-form-games","games_count":4,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/245579c536d2a06e69d391573d911679.jpg"},{"id":1531,"name":"Final Form","slug":"final-form-llc","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/245579c536d2a06e69d391573d911679.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/"},{"description":"Taking a trip back to Raccoon City won’t be a walk in the park, of course.

It’s against this backdrop that Jill Valentine prepares to make her escape, though there’s a bit of a twist in the timeline for those of you who aren’t familiar with the original. If you played Resident Evil 2 earlier this year, you may know that Leon and Claire arrived in the city on September 29th. Jill’s story, however, starts a few days earlier.

The game was initially developed as a student project for DADIU. The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter.\n\nThe player's objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player.\n\nThe game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There's also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker's outfit or simply the typography of the game.","id":7353,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":2316,"name":"Bedtime Digital Games","slug":"bedtime-digital-games","games_count":12,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c09/c0940bddb52460b08be3e36ba1a2cb6d.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.bedtimedigitalgames.dk"},{"description":"PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS is battle-royale shooter made only for the multiplayer experience. Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates.

Excellent reviews and 92/100 score on Metacritic is a serious indicator. In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. \n\n###The story\nIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nIn addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net.

Visually, Dead Bits somewhat reminds Minecraft, but gameplay-wise, it’s a combination of the first-person shooter with platforming elements. \nThe protagonist named Quilly was kidnapped by the aliens led by Quanton. Quilly has to complete a series of tests for Quanton before he is released. The “tests” actually consist of short levels in which you fight zombies and giant humanoid robots made of boxes. The protagonist starts each level armed with either a gun, an iron stick, or even nothing at all at some levels where you have to find the weapons yourself. Most levels are set on the platforms floating in the middle of nowhere, though there’s also a claustrophobic corridor level with limited visibility. Outside of the cutscenes, there’s no character model. Quilly has no visible legs and casts no shadow, which makes navigating the platforms way more difficult than one might expect.

The game consists of 6 non-related cases.\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues.

This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant.

In Duel, the players start with their own hand of cards, while in Arena each player picks the hand out of a limited number of cards.\r\n\r\nThe cards are divided into four categories: Creatures, Supports, Actions, and Items. The players decide which Tamriel race they want to play as. This choice affects the additional cards that will be dropped as a reward after leveling up.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the match, each player starts out with one magic point and three cards. On each turn, one magic point is granted to the players. The first player to get his enemies health to less than 1 wins.","id":332,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":4,"name":"Bethesda Softworks","slug":"bethesda-softworks","games_count":62,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a0e/a0ef08621301a1eab5e04fa5c96978fa.jpeg"},{"id":3674,"name":"Dire Wolf Digital","slug":"dire-wolf-digital","games_count":17,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a297408dd0b8464c39edf6807936d328.jpg"}],"website":"https://legends.bethesda.net/?locale=en"},{"description":"Pre-Existing UsersThe Steam version of Black Desert Online requires the purchase of the game from Steam as well as the creation of a new Black Desert Online account.

The period for the world of the game is the middle of the 21st century, the time in which all the armed forces were dissolved, and the law-enforcement function was assigned to the police under the name Consortium.

Also note the unusual implementation of the dialogue tree: the developers sought to recreate lifelike conversations, each response changes the attitude of the NPCs to the main character.

The game takes heavy inspiration from Minecraft and improves upon it concepts.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players come into possession of a gauntlet that allows them to manipulate matter. The players create their own character and customize it before being put in a procedurally generated world. The game teaches the players to interact with this world and gives the first tools and tips to do so. \n\nCreativerse improves upon Minecraft's multiplayer modes, as the players do not have to install server-side mods to activate the possibilities of claiming land and the protection of player-created buildings.\n\nThe player progression in Creativerse is made through the recipe system that expands as the players discover more and more crafting recipes. The game's crafting system heavily resembles the same of Minecraft, as the players find resources in the generated world's biomes. These materials are later used to create new items that can also be used to later build more sophisticated tools and weapons. Several very rare recipes can be obtained through combat or dungeon exploration.\n\n###Paid version features\nThe paid version of the game allows creating as many worlds as the players like, grants 20 more inventory slots and new items, such as a flashlight.","id":9677,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":48311,"name":"playful","slug":"playful","games_count":5,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06cae9d547252654ee2b93a739a588da.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.creativersegame.com"},{"description":"The world is a vast, beautiful, and dangerous place – especially when you have been shrunken to the size of an ant.

This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.\n\nLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\nExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.","id":274762,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":409,"name":"Obsidian Entertainment","slug":"obsidian-entertainment","games_count":42,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8c8/8c8e92ef385fb2394a96cee14061c901.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.theouterworlds.com/"},{"description":"Bioterrorism ...

Many necessary items in the game, including some of the weapons, need to be crafted out of the junk that you can find in the woods and in abandoned buildings.\nIn the story mode, called Wintermute, you control a pilot, Will Mackenzie, who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually, his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured, and Astrid is missing, presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion. Wintermute follows a linear plot and only allows you to explore a limited area. However, it is recommended to start with, since it serves as a sort of tutorial to the open-world sandbox mode. This is the most popular mode, in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas.","id":11312,"alternative_names":[],"developers":[{"id":13340,"name":"Hinterland Studio","slug":"hinterland-studio-inc-2","games_count":1,"image_background":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fd2/fd20a68d7ef195855588c937865dd0a7.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.hinterlandgames.com"},{"description":"The game takes place a few days after the events of the first part of Orcs must die!.

They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks.

It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000.

The protagonist arrives at the kingdom of Mrytana that was recently conquered by a horde of orcs with the help of a rogue wizard. Only a handful of humans, led by their king, still maintain their resistance in the capital that is protected by a magic shield. The rest of the human population is enslaved by orcs. The Nameless Hero is expected to save the kingdom; however, the player is free to choose to help orcs instead or even side with some other faction, like Nomads. There are six factions in the game, of which three will allow the protagonist to join after he reaches a certain level of reputation with them. \nLike previous parts of its series, Gothic 3 is set in an open-world high fantasy setting, and its gameplay reminds that of The Elder Scrolls series. You can explore cities, forests and deep underground caves, accept quests from NPCs, and fight a variety of monsters and wild animals to level up and learn additional skills for battle, magic or crafting.

Twelve years ago, Duke defeated invading aliens and became a worldwide celebrity, but now another invasion forces him to go out of retirement. He has to save all the Earth's women, who are being kidnapped by aliens. Most weapons are the same as in the original game. However, this time Duke cannot carry all his arsenals and is restricted to only two weapons at a time. He can also use “holoduke”, a holographic version of himself, to distract enemies. Duke restores his health over time using a new mechanic of “ego bar” — a measurement of Duke’s enormous ego that needs to be bolstered.\n\nThis belated sequel to Duke Nukem 3D spent 15 years in development, so it may feel like an artifact from another era. This is especially obvious from the game’s vulgar black humor. The protagonist may urinate, drink beer, and tell somewhat chauvinistic jokes about women.
